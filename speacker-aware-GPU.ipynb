       "'[CLS]A:Germany!\\n\\nJust the person I want to speak with. I have a somewhat crazy idea that I’ve always wanted to try with I/G, but I’ve never actually convinced the other guy to try it. And, what’s worse, it might make you suspicious of me. \\n\\nSo...do I suggest it?\\n\\nI’m thinking that this is a low stakes game, not a tournament or anything, and an interesting and unusual move set might make it more fun? That’s my hope anyway.\\n\\nWhat is your appetite like for unusual and crazy?[SEP]B:You\\'ve whet my appetite, Italy. What\\'s the suggestion?[SEP]A:👍[SEP]B:It seems like there are a lot of ways that could go wrong...I don\\'t see why France would see you approaching/taking Munich--while I do nothing about it--and not immediately feel skittish[SEP]A:Yeah, I can’t say I’ve tried it and it works, cause I’ve never tried it or seen it. But how I think it would work is (a) my Spring move looks like an attack on Austria, so it would not be surprising if you did not cover Munich. Then (b) you build two armies, which looks like we’re really at war and you’re going to eject me. Then we launch the attack in Spring. So there is really no part of this that would raise alarm bells with France.\\n\\nAll that said, I’ve literally never done it before, and it does involve risk for you, so I’m not offended or concerned if it’s just not for you. I’m happy to play more conventionally too. Up to you.[SEP]A:I am just sensing that you don’t like this idea, so shall we talk about something else? That was just a crazy idea I’ve always wanted to try. I’m happy to play more conservatively.[SEP]A:Any thoughts?[SEP]B:Sorry Italy I\\'ve been away doing, um, German things. Brewing Lagers?[SEP]B:I don\\'t think I\\'m ready to go for that idea, however I\\'d be down for some good ol\\'-fashioned Austria-kicking?[SEP]A:I am pretty conflicted about whether to guess that you were telling the truth or lying about the “brewing lagers” thing. I am going to take it literally and say 👎 even though I don’t think you meant it deceptively. 😉[SEP]A:But I think I can get over “Lagergate” and we can still be friends. \\n\\nAs of right now, I think Austria may be my most reliable ally. I’m thinking I’d like to play as a Central Trio if you have any interest in that. Thoughts?[SEP]B:We haven\\'t even passed a season yet and you have a \\'most reliable ally\\'?\\n\\nI\\'ll consider this proposal but, basically, I\\'m not going to expose myself to risk from either of you until I\\'ve seen a bit of your behavior[SEP]A:Well, at least I have an idea of who to trust. Obviously, my ideas are subject to change. \\n\\nI understand your desire to watch behavior before committing to anything. I, personally, am a partner player. I look carefully early in the game for a small group to work with, and then I value loyalty and collaboration. I like to work closely with a tight-knit alliance. \\n\\nIf you prefer to hop and back and forth, or play more of an individual game, then we might not be a good match. \\n\\nI’m looking for a loyal ally or two that I can coordinate with and make awesome moves with. Makes the game easier and a lot more fun.[SEP]A:Just an FYI: I’ve now had both England and France suggest to me that I should move to Tyrolia and France will support me to Munich in the Fall. One saying that to me is not a big deal, but with both mentioning it, my alarm bells are going off. I am concerned about an E/F. \\n\\nI’m certainly not moving to Tyrolia. But I just want you to be cautious here. I feel like England and France are working together.[SEP]B:I appreciate the tip, but I\\'m wondering why you\\'re so against ousting me from Munich if I haven\\'t explicitly agreed to be your ally?[SEP]A:Because it is terrible, terrible play for Italy to attack Germany, in my view. If I were to attack you in Munich, I could never hold Munich. So, all I would be doing is weakening you, and helping France, England, or both to get really big. \\n\\nI don’t have any long-term path going north. Helping France to take you down is a sucker’s play, whether you are working with me or not.[SEP]A:Did France tell you he was moving to Burgundy, or was that a stab?[SEP]B:I was not informed of it, no. And England is leading me to believe it\\'s part of a play for Belgium, so if they\\'re working together this might be a trick...\\n\\nItaly, you seem like a straight shooter, and Austria has confirmed with me about your two\\'s alliance. So I\\'ll confide in you--this is my first ever game of diplomacy, and I think that teaming up with the two of you could help me learn more and have more fun. So, if you\\'re still interested in a central powers alliance, I\\'m in.[SEP]B:Okay full disclosure: I\\'m not very smart, and I accidentally let slip to England that you told me France was plotting to take Munich. I\\'m sorry for the error but I figured it was better to admit it so you know that England/France may not trust you.[SEP]A:Okay, thanks for telling me.[SEP]B:So, um, no alliance then?[SEP]A:I do want to be allies. Sorry, busy weekend here running around with bambinos. More to come.[SEP]B:What would you think of helping me take Marseilles in two turns?[SEP]A:Hi Germany, I’ll certainly consider that. Though, I’ll note: traditionally, Germany would help Italy to Marseilles if the two of them work together there. The reason is that: if I help you to Marseilles, I’m basically cut off from going west and getting anything myself. So, usually, Germany would help Italy into Marseilles to encourage Italy to come west and Germany would plan to take Paris, Belgium and Brest.[SEP]B:Fair enough--I\\'ll help you take it, then, but I\\'ll need to deal with Belgium first.[SEP]A:How are things going with England? I think that getting him to work with you is the main key here.[SEP]B:I\\'m trying--I just offered to assist with taking Sweden in exchange for some assistance into Belgium...not sure if they\\'ll go for it...[SEP]A:I’ll check with England and try to see where his head is at.[SEP]B:I\\'ve actually been thinking about this game all day 😅  and have come up with a plan I like a bit better... but England still hasn\\'t responded to my initial offer.[SEP]A:That’s the worst!\\n\\nAnd I’m glad to see you’re so focused on this in your first game. It’s a really great game if you put in the time and effort![SEP]B:You\\'re definitely telling the truth on that one. So can I count on you to move to piedmont this season?[SEP]A:I don’t think I can afford to move to Piedmont this season. I don’t really trust Austria to avoid walking through that door if I leave it wide open. \\n\\nI think you need to get England on board to attack France.[SEP]B:That\\'s valid. And actually I was conferring with England and we concluded that it\\'s not really gonna be possible for me to help you take Marseilles this year anyway. \\n\\n...what are you and Austria planning for this year, then? I\\'m willing to tell you my plans in exchange as a gesture of trust. \\n\\nHave you communicated at all with England or France?[SEP]A:Hi, are you there?\\n\\nJust woke up. \\n\\nEngland did return my message, but he did not tell me anything substantive so I really don’t know what he’s doing. I’m planning to move towards Turkey.[SEP]A:Well, you’re in trouble. That England move is trouble. \\n\\nI’m going to try to convince him to change course. I suggest you be very kind to him, and don’t burn that bridge. I think your game hinges on turning England around.[SEP]A:Hi Germany,\\n\\nI’m working hard on turning England. And I’m also trying to get Russia to come to your aid. Doing the best I can! I’ll keep you posted.[SEP]B:England just told me that Russia is helping them to take Denmark so that may be a lost cause. Granted, the source for that intel is a serpentine jackal-spawn[SEP]A:Okay, I’m reasonably sure that England wants to take the Channel and attack France now. \\n\\nI believe that you should basically do whatever England asks to help make this happen. As long as E attacks F, you will be in a much better position, and you’ll gain back centers quickly. \\n\\nWhat are you hearing?[SEP]B:What are your plans for this turn? I can\\'t help but notice that Munich is surrounded by foreign armies on three sides...\\n\\nI wish I could be more helpful but I\\'m pretty much just treading water right now trying not to lose anything else[SEP]A:Hey — sorry, just getting back into this now.[SEP]A:I have good news! (1) I am finally attacking France this turn. (2) I will be supporting Munich to hold from Tyrolia. \\n\\nLet’s turn this game around, yes?[SEP]A:I am pretty sure that England is not attacking you this turn. And I am committed to supporting Munich holding. Make sure you don’t move Munich so that it can take my support.[SEP]B:Okay, can do. Thanks![SEP]A:I suggest that you order:\\nKiel Support Berlin holding\\nBerlin Support Munich holding\\nHelg to Holland\\nMunich Support Berlin holding[SEP]B:I agree completely--although I didn\\'t know that a country could hold *and* support at the same time! Thanks![SEP]B:Thanks Italy. Hope you\\'re enjoying the weather on the Anatolian 😉[SEP]A:I will be supporting Munich to hold again. And I’ll be trying to get Russia to back off your flank and protect himself against an Austrian stab that is coming.[SEP]A:Two bits of advice: #1 I suggest you tell Russia that Austria is coming for him. You really want Russia to move Sil back to Gal. You might also suggest to Russia that is he supports you to Denmark, you will then support Russia back to Sweden. I don’t know yet if it actually makes sense to do that, but you want Russia thinking that you are eager to work with him. He’ll be hoping for a reason to break off his attack on you at this point.[SEP]A:#2 Here is the move set I would suggest right now:\\nKiel Support Holland holding\\nHolland Support Wales to Belgium (tell England you are going to order this support and he can take it or leave it)\\nMunich Support Berlin holding\\nBerlin Support Munich holding\\n\\nI think that both France and Russia are about to back off you, as they are both under fire at home. Just hold still, and soon you should be able to break out of this holding pattern.[SEP]B:God, I hope so! I\\'m attempting to make that deal with russia now...and I\\'m talking with England re: Belgium[SEP]A:It’s none of my business, but if you do plan to take Denmark, I strongly recommend you wait until Fall. I think the most important thing for you right now is getting England fully committed against France. If that happens, taking Denmark later will be easy.[SEP]B:I think me and England are really on the same page at this point regarding France. I\\'m actually sort of running counter-intelligence for England (and my friends to the south, of course!) with Russia right now. \\n\\nEngland and I talked about Denmark too...and it seems like one or the other of Denmark or Belgium should work out for me this year and I\\'m fine with that[SEP]A:Great to hear. Thank you.[SEP]B:Do you need me to disrupt Bur this year? I\\'ll need to seriously trust Russia if I\\'m going to risk not holding my eastern front, I think...[SEP]A:I do think a move to Burgundy makes sense for you this turn, and I can’t imagine Russia attacking you here. He has a serious Austria problem. \\n\\nI suggest this:\\nMun - Bur\\nRuh - Bel\\nHol Support Ruh - Bel \\nBer - Kie\\n\\nTell Russia that the last thing in the world you want to see is Austria run him over, and you’re willing to help keep Russia viable if necessary (you’re angling for Russia to disband his northern holdings this turn).[SEP]A:And ask England nicely to support Ruh - Hol, with the explanation that you don’t plan to ask for Denmark back, but you think it would help you both to diminish France. (You’ll get Den back eventually, but you want England to think you don’t care about it).[SEP]B:Thanks, I\\'ll work on these. \\n...Why didn\\'t you scooch into the Aegean behind Austria? You could have defended or even held Bulgaria this turn?[SEP]B:England and I were talking about your moves for this season--what do you think of convoying Pie into Spa, supporting this with Wes, and then moving Tyr into Pie?[SEP]B:This leaves Marseilles open for Bur to fall into if France goes that route, which gives me an opening into Bur[SEP]A:That’s not bad.[SEP]A:I was kind of thinking I should pick one or the other of Marseilles or Spain to attack and not tell a soul which one I’m going after.[SEP]A:Do you really think it’s important to coordinate?[SEP]A:I do think you’re best off moving to Burgundy. And there is some chance that we fail this turn. But I think we just take a guess and hope for the best. We’ll get him next turn if not this one.[SEP]B:Okay—sorry for being nosy! I will try for bur on the off chance it shakes out that way[SEP]A:Nah, you’re not being nosy at all. I mean, come on, we both know that I have no problem sticking my nose where it doesn’t belong.[SEP]B:Marked as true[SEP]A:I like to coordinate, but on these sort of 50/50 guesses, I kind of like to keep it secret so that if it doesn’t go well, I have nobody to blame but myself.[SEP]A:Ha![SEP]B:Well, are you willing to humor my question about the Aegean, anyway?[SEP]A:Sure. I was thinking of moving that fleet to Ionian. You think a move to Aegean is better? I’m not really sure, but let’s talk it through.[SEP]B:No sorry I meant in hindsight--like this past turn you should have moved to Aeg so that this current turn, when Austria takes Rumania (from Bulgaria), you\\'d be there to cover Bulgaria so it couldn\\'t get scooped by the Black sea, and potentially you\\'d just get to take it.[SEP]A:Not a bad point. I agree.[SEP]A:Hmmmm, kind of a pointless lie if you ask me, but I won’t hold it against you. You’re in a tough spot.[SEP]B:um what lie? I did exactly the moves you suggested![SEP]A:Ha! So sorry!! I meant that for France![SEP]A:You are my favorite.[SEP]B:Marked as lie because clearly austria is your favorite.\\nSpeaking of, I assume that your seizing Trieste was mutually agreed upon?[SEP]A:Yes — agreed upon.[SEP]B:That\\'s not what Austria said to England...[SEP]A:Hmmmm, okay. Well, let’s just keep that between you and me then. 🤦\\u200d♂️[SEP]B:You know italy, I think we *do* need to coordinate your move this time--England and I have a shot at either Bur or Mao if one of Marseilles or Spain can be left open for France to fall into. This will improve all of our chances of crushing France quickly.[SEP]A:Okay, I can dig it. What do you want me to do?[SEP]B:Let me confer with England and get back to you. Glad to hear that though![SEP]A:So...any thoughts on how to approach this?[SEP]B:It looks like England\\'s not willing to try for MAO if it means possibly losing the channel. However, they\\'ll bring the NWG fleet around to try for MAO next year. \\nSo if you could keep Marseilles open, it will help me to try and take Burgundy this turn.[SEP]A:If I leave Marseilles open, would you kindly use Burgundy in the Fall to help me take Marseilles? (Likely that means ordering Burgundy to Gascony to cut support)[SEP]B:Will do.[SEP]B:Okay, so I still have a teensy little bone to pick with you: on the off-chance that Austria wasn\\'t lying and you *did* take Trieste unexpectedly, I sort of worry that I might be next. Are you willing to tell me what your plans are for the Tri unit, or at least to warn me before any move into Tyrolia?[SEP]A:Sure. But, you’ll see from my moves this turn that Austria is lying to you.[SEP]A:I currently have Tri - Tyrolia. I like the unit there because it sets up an attack on Austria if I ever want to go that route (build A Ven and go east). Do you want me to keep Tyrolia clear?[SEP]A:I’ll add — I would never attack Germany as Italy. Setting myself as a giant column like that is just not defensible. It would be a terrible move.[SEP]B:Not when that column is not-so-giant and in a turf war with France.[SEP]B:oh you mean setting *yourself*[SEP]B:But you could easily pick off, say, Munich and not be a \"giant column\"[SEP]A:I mean this sincerely: any Germany who does that is a terrible player. \\n\\nWhy would I do that? I would need 2-3 units to hold one center. That is a net negative. And all of your units are doing things that are good for me in containing your neighbors. \\n\\nI’ve been working hard in this game for you to succeed and knock back France and England. I can say with 100% certainty: I’m not going to attack you. I’m going to keep helping you as much as I can.[SEP]A:That said, if you want me NOT to move to Tyrolia, I won’t move there.[SEP]B:Nah, I just needed some reassurance :)\\nYour logic is undenyable— enjoy your stay in tyr![SEP]B:*undeniable? That looks better[SEP]A:I mean it sincerely. I think that England will want to coax me to attack you with him after France falls, but I’d much rather work with you against England. \\n\\nBut first thing’s first — let’s get rid of France.[SEP]B:Agreed[SEP]B:(On the france part)[SEP]B:Sorry I won\\'t be able to cut off Gascony this turn...I probably should have just told you my moves; you could have advised me that supporting Mun-Bur was more important than Kie-Ruh[SEP]A:No worries. We’ll crack this but eventually. \\n\\nHere is my suggestion for this turn:\\nKie - Den\\nHol S Bel holding\\nBel S Ruh - Bur\\nMun S Ruh - Bur\\nRuh - Bur[SEP]A:I think you should suggest to England that he gets Sweden and St Petersburg, while you get Denmark back. That’s only fair, as you have been a loyal ally in the fight against France and you plan to continue to do that.[SEP]B:The moves I had already planned differ in one respect: I thought it would be worth the risk to try moving Hol-Bel and therefore move Bel-Bur. Even if me and France are high-fiving in Bel for a few seasons it\\'s still mine, and it\\'s not like Holland has anything better to do while I\\'m still allies with England.\\n\\n...The only reason I\\'m reluctant to make that agreement with England is that---while I think *you* and I have a good relationship---I really have not talked with Austria much at all, and I\\'m the next logical target for them when Russia\\'s gone. And anything that\\'s bad for Russia right now is good for Austria.[SEP]A:Hmmmm, I’m just not sure you should trust England enough right now to leave Holland open and Belgium essentially unguarded. \\n\\nFrance is a really good player, and he is no doubt working hard to get England to turn on you. My personal take is that you are better off being a bit more conservative until you have Denmark back and England has moved another fleet towards France. But I can see it either way.[SEP]A:With regard to Russia, talk it through with England. What you don’t want is England taking out Russia and giving you nothing. So, if England agrees to let Russia be for a while, then your plan sounds good. But if England is going to take Sweden, you really should get Denmark back. (I’m my view)[SEP]B:Okay you\\'ve convinced me: it\\'s worth figuring out what E\\'s plans are for Russia at least.\\n\\nAnd you\\'re almost certainly right, from a rational perspective, about leaving Holland/Belgium vulnerable to England. But I think England really is counting on my assistance in taking France, and because of that and other non-quantifiable reasons I trust them.[SEP]A:Excellent. Obviously you have a much better feel for your relationship with England than I do. Just know that France is persuasive, and I’m sure that’s what he’s working on. He stopped talking to me, so I bet he’s trying to turn England. Just keep reassuring England that you want to work with him long-term so he doesn’t succumb to the Dark Side.[SEP]A:Hi Germany — well, I think we’re getting to a critical point in the game here. France held out a long time, but he’s much less of a threat now. I think the critical issue, for you, is England. \\n\\nI have some thoughts on the matter, and some information, but I’d like to feel confident that you and I will keep anything we say between us. I think of you as the one person who has been honest with me on every turn. You even tell me the truth when it’s bad news, or when you don’t completely trust me, and I like that.[SEP]B:Okay, Italy. I won\\'t share any of this conversation. But in the interest of continued full disclosure, here\\'s what I think: England is a greater threat to *me* on the map, but *you* have a greater chance of soloing this game quickly, or pair-winning with Austria even sooner. And if I continue to collaborate with England, we at least have a chance of slowing that down. So I\\'m in sort of a conflicted spot[SEP]A:This is why I like you. The full disclosure part. You tell me the truth even when the news isn’t great.[SEP]A:My thoughts on the “Germany/England forever so that at least we can stop the solo” strategy: (1) It’s quite early to be talking about solos. I am at 8, and Austria could take 3 from me any time, quite easily. (2) I don’t think England is thinking that way. I think he’s thinking that a dominant power will emerge in the north, and one will emerge in the south. And he’s like to be that dominant power.[SEP]A:England’s pieces are not positioned well if he’s trying to attack France or contain Italy. He keeps Denmark guarded, and North Sea filled. He is not playing like he intends to stick with you, even though I’m sure he’s telling you that.[SEP]A:You’re right that you don’t want to start a war with England right now. But, you must stick up for yourself, because nobody else will do that if you don’t.[SEP]A:If I were you, this is what I would do: (1) keep warning England about the dangers of Italy getting too big and insist that England moves his fleets towards MAO (Channel to Irish, Norwegian to NAO, North - Channel), (2) insist on taking Denmark back.[SEP]A:I would say something like this:\\n\\nEngland, I’m with you my friend, but we’re passed the stage of you needing to keep me under lock and key. I need to take Denmark back. I’m happy to support you to Brest to keep you growing, or you can grab Sweden. You have plenty of options other than keeping your ally’s center, but if you really want to be my ally long-term, you’ve got to show me that.[SEP]A:I am hearing from England signs that he may be thinking of attacking you soon. And I think you actually avoid that better by being strong and sticking up for yourself rather than being accommodating and letting him do whatever he wants to do.[SEP]B:Well, both you and France have now pointed out that England is strategically not in a good place to be my ally right now, and you are correct. I\\'ll be more cautious with my northern border, but I made a pretty strong argument for denmark this past turn and it fell on deaf ears[SEP]B:...which probably also should have been a sign for me[SEP]A:Well, if you want, you could just take Denmark this next year and I don’t think England is in a position to retaliate.[SEP]B:Probably not...has France been talking with you at all about their sunsetting strategy? They\\'ve indicated a willingness to work with you and me and a desire to see England get as few dots as possible[SEP]A:He did say that to me too. Though, France has a long history of lying to me, so I really don’t trust him.[SEP]B:Well France has actually been pretty honest with me, and I at least am certain that they wouldn\\'t betray me to England. So, I\\'m considering working with F to sabotage (or potentially full-on backstab) England this turn, which would have the side-effect of maybe taking some attention away from the south for you anyway.[SEP]B:(and I\\'d be interested to hear your thoughts on this if you\\'re in the mood to give out free advice)[SEP]A:Hi Germany — sorry for the delay. Well...I think it’s really important that you get a build this turn either way. I don’t think England will get a build this turn, so if I were you I’d probably take Paris, build a fleet, and move on England after that.[SEP]A:But it likely depends on how communication is going with England. If he’ll give you back Denmark, that might change the equation.[SEP]B:I am waiting on England to make a decision about that--they claim to be thinking about it.[SEP]B:England told me you said I was plotting with France. It makes sense you’d want to pit us against each other.[SEP]A:Hey — tried to send you a message earlier but not was down. England was telling me that you’re saying that I told you that England is plotting against you. The problem with telling England that is that he will stop giving me useful info.[SEP]A:Truly, I don’t want you and England to fight. I am not trying to break you up. I suggested that you take Paris! I want you guys to work together with me against France.[SEP]B:You don\\'t want us to fight, yet you betrayed both of our confidence with you in a way that makes us distrust each other?[SEP]A:I really don’t think that’s a fair description. You guys both wanted to attack each other. I encouraged you both to keep working together.[SEP]B:Just as long as it suits you. Are you going to give England Mao?[SEP]A:Hmmm, should I be reading that as angry sarcastic with dagger eyes? (I’m not sure if I’m getting your tone right)[SEP]A:We’re friends, right? I believe that every single message I’ve sent you all game has been truth, and I’ve gone out of my way to give you candid advice. Are we still friends?[SEP]A:Regarding MAO — I don’t know. What do you want me to do? I don’t have any set plan.[SEP]B:Yep, there\\'s some sarcasm there. Looking back at your messages, I still don\\'t read them as encouraging collaboration. And if you wanted us to be friends, you could have done that without betraying me to England by simply saying in your candid way \"I don\\'t think you should do that for such and such reason\". But you chose to increase E\\'s distrust of me. So I think you might be full of gnocchi and crap. \\n\\nMy trust in you is a bit shaken but I still think we can have a working partnership with a bit more caution on my end. It would be my preference that you hold Mao, on the assumption that if it came down to a choice between partnering with me or England, you\\'d choose me. If that\\'s not the case, then as the filling of an England-Italy sandwich I\\'m in no position to retaliate anyway.[SEP]A:Well, again, I like that you’re honest with me, even when the news is bad.[SEP]A:I have to say that I’m surprised that you feel that I’ve betrayed your trust. I have been feeling like maybe I’ve been TOO helpful to you, and been a bit over the top in offering advice, etc., but it seems like I’ve misread the situation.[SEP]B:No, it\\'s completely true that you\\'ve been too helpful, and I\\'m really really grateful for it because I\\'ve been able to learn so much from this game. But it\\'s also true that you didn\\'t have to tell England what you did, and all you stood to gain from it was that it shook my and E\\'s trust in each other.[SEP]A:But I understand what you’re saying, and I much prefer to have a heart to heart like this, a frank airing of grievances, rather than being surprised by unkind moves on the board. https://youtu.be/xoirV6BbjOg[SEP]B:Was not expecting seinfeld today and it was a pleasant surprise[SEP]A:🤗[SEP]A:Here’s the deal: I like you better than England.[SEP]A:I’m not sure how the next couple of turns are going to shake out. But I like that you tell me when you’re angry with me. I know that may seem like a small thing, but it’s just rare in Diplomacy. You get so many fake smiles.[SEP]A:So, if it comes down to you or him, I’m choosing you. And I’ll work to do a better job of keeping your confidence. I certainly understand how important that is, as I hate it when people o that same thing to me.[SEP]A:So no more playing mediator for me.[SEP]B:Okay. Is it true that you want the channel?[SEP]B:And are you planning to keep Vienna?[SEP]A:I am not planning to keep Vienna. And yeah I’ve asked France for support to the Channel. Do you think he’s on board?[SEP]B:I\\'m not sure. Is *England* on board? Is this something England can know about?[SEP]A:No, do you think France will Support me to the Channel?[SEP]B:France has asked my opinion on it, and I haven\\'t given it yet. To my estimation things look a lot better for me if you don\\'t end up there: I don\\'t want to see England in Mao, and I don\\'t want to see you snagging pieces of the north.[SEP]A:Okay, well, here is my thinking. Tell France whatever you want to make him happy. Then tell me how you really feel. And if you don’t want me to go there, I won’t go there.[SEP]B:If I hadn\\'t asked you about it, would that have just been another surprise, too?[SEP]A:Absolutely. \\n\\nYou and I have discussed our moves and been honest with each other every turn. But we have not been sharing all our moves or pre-clearing all of our moves. So that would have Ben a surprise in the same way that your moves are a surprise to me. (I never tell you what to do or insist on knowing).[SEP]A:I kind of thought that you would have wanted me in the Channel because it commits me further against England, but I can understand what you’re saying now about wanting me to hang back.[SEP]A:But I don’t think there is anything wrong with me contemplating moves without telling you all of them. You asked me about it, and I told you the truth.[SEP]B:I do think that this move is a breach of general expectation, which is the kind of thing I\\'d like to know about. And it\\'s also the kind of thing I\\'ve shared with you: case in point, my desire to stab England.[SEP]A:Okay. Understood.[SEP]B:Is there anything I could gain from seeing you in the channel? Would you support me taking Nth, and potentially seizing the island?[SEP]B:Here\\'s what I\\'m thinking: I would be on board with you taking the channel (and I\\'d give France the green light to go ahead with it) if you would agree to bump Nao out of Mao using Wes, and if you\\'d be open to supporting some anti-English aggression while holding the channel so that I can get on equal footing with you, dot-wise.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t want to agree to those terms, that\\'s okay, but I would strongly prefer not to see you in the channel in that case.[SEP]A:I’m going to be out of pocket this weekend, so let’s talk this through more on Monday. Generally, I agree that I’ll either stay out of the Channel or agree to your terms for entering there.[SEP]B:If you decide to stay out of the channel, I have a deal that I like with England in the works. For that deal to go through, you\\'d have to agree to move Mao into Portugal to let England take Mao. Would you be amenable to that?[SEP]B:(If this second offer is more to think about than a no-brainer, you can just mull it over and let me know monday)[SEP]A:So, here is my concern with the England offer: If I’m taking Portugal, why do we want England in MAO? And why would he want to go to MAO? I’m not sure I understand that one. Can you explain?[SEP]B:Well, when I initially proposed the deal I had forgotten that Portugal was promised to England. Then England agreed to it on the condition that you would confirm that move, so I figured E thought you would just move out of there next year? But now that I think about it, it’s probably worth asking England why they’d agree to that.[SEP]A:I’d prefer that you not tell England I am considering moving to the Channel. I don’t think he would like that.[SEP]A:I don’t really want to discuss this stuff with England at all.[SEP]B:Well, England changed their mind about the plan I offered anyway. So, are you taking the channel?[SEP]A:No, I’m not taking the Channel.[SEP]B:Okay was that a recent decision? Because like an hour ago France said they were supporting you into the channel[SEP]A:Well, when I tell you what I plan to do, do you turn around and tell France? This makes me uncomfortable speaking with you.[SEP]B:I haven\\'t spoken to France since then. I didn\\'t realize you were giving the two of us different information on this particular subject. But I don\\'t think I\\'ve revealed anything to them about what you plan to do. Mostly because you haven\\'t told me.[SEP]A:Well, I have been honest with both you and France. You told me that I need to promise you a set of things in order to take the Channel. I felt like it was more than I could be sure of doing, so I am not entering the Channel. I won’t go there without your permission.[SEP]B:I appreciate that. And I\\'ll keep the remainder of this conversation between us unless I hear otherwise. Have you just recently made an agreement with England?[SEP]B:I heard as much but I want to verify the contents of that agreement with you[SEP]B:Btw, France just said that they submitted the orders to support you into the channel.[SEP]A:I don’t have an agreement with England, but he is asking me about my moves and trying to get my help.[SEP]B:Okay--then England is lying to me, saying that you\\'re helping support Eng-Brest.[SEP]A:Ha! Yeah, fat chance.[SEP]B:...but did you lie to England about that? Or can I say to England that I don\\'t think you\\'ll actually provide that support?[SEP]A:What is Paris up to?[SEP]A:I suggest you just not tell England anything about my moves.[SEP]A:Do you want me to support England to Brest?[SEP]A:I guess I’m not sure what your goals are here.[SEP]A:I just kind of feel like you’re grilling me with a lot of questions, but not telling me what you’re doing or what you want from me.[SEP]B:*If* you support Eng-Brest, England has agreed to vacate denmark for me. If you don\\'t, I won\\'t get in the way of your channel thing. Any other questions?[SEP]B:I have no sense of what you want or what your plan is, but I thought I\\'d been pretty clear: I want Denmark. I am reluctant to see you in the Channel if England remains powerful, but happy to see you there if they are weakened.[SEP]A:Can’t you just force Denmark?[SEP]B:Not without risking a swipe of Belgium[SEP]B:And why force when you don\\'t have to[SEP]A:Okay, I’ll support England to Brest. You take Denmark.[SEP]A:And you and I should be in position to take out England next year.[SEP]B:Splendid![SEP]B:Glad everything worked out 😃[SEP]A:👍[SEP]A:Congratulations on retaking Denmark and getting two builds. You are playing really well right now. Respect.[SEP]B:Congrats on having double-digit dots! I have some thoughts about taking out England, if you want to go full-stab this season...[SEP]A:I think I do! 🤫[SEP]A:What are you thinking?[SEP]B:One option is to take the channel, another is to take Brest. Between you, me, and Picardy we can manage either, but it\\'s a question of which takes priority. If we chose Brest, I could also take a stab at seizing Nth this season, then we could try for the channel in fall. Or we could do channel first, Brest second.[SEP]A:Yeah, that is all along the lines of what I’m thinking. How demanding does France sound right now? Does he want to be the one who takes Brest?[SEP]B:Haven\\'t asked. But in general not demanding.[SEP]A:Good!\\n\\nStill, I think we should show him some good faith by supporting him to Brest in Spring. We can decide in Fall whether it makes more sense for you to take it, but I think we want to keep France hungry.[SEP]A:I would suggest something like this to ensure the English fleet is disbanded:\\nPic - Bre\\nMAO - Channel\\nPar S Pic - Bre[SEP]A:And Spa - Gas to cut off that retreat.[SEP]A:You can take the North Sea on the same move and set up a convoy to the English mainland. \\n\\nCheckmate.[SEP]B:Okay, I like the plan! I\\'ve asked France if they\\'re willing to move to Brest supported by me.[SEP]B:Aren\\'t you concerned about England taking Mao? I\\'d sooner just have you pile on support into Bre so that Wes can support Mao holding[SEP]A:That’s a good point, but the problem with that approach is that Brest is not guaranteed. If England cute MAO and supports with the Channel, the attack fails. I think we are better off ensuring that the Brest fleet is disbanded. If we disband that fleet and take North Sea, an English fleet in MAO really just spreads him out and allows you to take the island faster. It’s not like he can get Portugal or Spain.[SEP]B:Okay, but that means I\\'d prefer to take Brest myself this Spring, if France is okay with it.[SEP]A:I think that we should offer France Brest in Spring. That ensures that he is with us. Then, if conditions are right in the Fall, I can support you into Brest. But...England can offer France Belgium, and I think he is sure to take that if we’re not even offering him a center, right?[SEP]A:Better to keep France feeling like we’re going to keep him in the game. If you need the build in Fall, it’s easy for me to support you there.[SEP]B:I guess I’m just wondering from France’s perspective why they’d *want* to stay in the game. Isn’t it possible they’d rather move on with their life? That’s not rhetorical, I’m wondering what your perspective is as a veteran player[SEP]A:Here is my take: If France just wanted to go down in a blaze of glory and say “eff you” to England, he would have kept Irish Sea. He kept Pic, which is next to his home center, and gives him a chance to negotiate with both you and England.[SEP]A:I think that means he is motivated to keep trying. And if he believes he can get Brest, he could legitimately get back to his feet. I know that’s what I’d be trying to do in his position.[SEP]A:As the poker saying goes: “a chip and a chair.” So long as you have one chip left, and you’re still in the tournament, you can always come back to win.[SEP]A:Thoughts?[SEP]B:I think that makes sense. Are you talking with England at all?[SEP]A:I’m pretty wary of England right now. He asked me what I want to do, but I feel like he’s trying to get me to leave MAO open. That’s not terrible news, as it suggests that he won’t expect your move to North Sea.[SEP]A:As long as he doesn’t move NAO to Norwegian, you’ve got a guaranteed supply center.[SEP]B:Well E\\'d have to be a right dolt not to retreat to NWG. And right now they\\'re talking to me about supporting a move from Bre to Gas (the better for the two of us to stab you).[SEP]B:What i mean is, there\\'s a good chance that Mao is safe if I \"agree\" to that deal[SEP]B:Oh nevermind--they\\'re not going to convoy into Brest. So actually this pretty much guarantees that Eng and Nao will try for Mao.[SEP]A:Ahhhh, sneaky Devil! Thank you for letting me know.[SEP]A:I still like our plan.[SEP]A:I need to run for a bit. I’ll be around in a few hours.[SEP]B:I think that knowing this, you should do as I suggest and not poke Eng. Just hold and let Wes support. I am 94% sure I can trust England to do as they say on this one.[SEP]A:Okay. Should I support Pic to Bre?[SEP]B:yes please. It\\'ll do us good with France too if we both support.[SEP]A:👍[SEP]B:Actually, you should use Mao to support Spa-Gas, since we know that Brest is moving there. It will be beneficial to have you there if we decide to oust France from Bre in fall[SEP]A:Consider it done.[SEP]A:Hmmmm, heading anything from England?[SEP]A:I’d love to talk if you’re there. I’m getting the impression that England may actually be moving on you, and I think I have a good counter, but I also still think we should support the attack on Brest and take North Sea.[SEP]A:I definitely think you should keep your moves the same.[SEP]A:Nice! Get’em! He WAS moving on you. But we should be able to take about 3 off of him now. Very nice turn.[SEP]B:Sorry; I was asleep by 9 last night 😂  \\n\\nwhy the move to Nao? Wouldn\\'t IRI be the more anti-England choice?\\n\\nWith the move to Picardy and assuming a retreat to SKA, it looks like England has me pretty powerless this turn.[SEP]B:So do you, it seems, if you have some kind of deal with Russia about Munich.[SEP]A:Good morning. \\n\\nJust responding to your messages above. I think NAO and Irish are equally anti-English. They both give me a clear lane to attack Liverpool. I wasn’t sure if either one would be left open, but I took a gamble and it paid off.[SEP]A:Re your move this turn, I don’t think you’re powerless. You should get a build I think and if not, you should be in position to smash England.[SEP]A:I don’t have a deal regarding Munich, Germany. Frankly, I thought you would be a bit more joyful towards me. By attacking England, I have committed completely to working as your partner.[SEP]B:I suppose you\\'re right. Initially I was thinking IRI also gives you channel access, but NWG access may be just as useful. \\n\\nWell when you control half a continent (and even more when you consider your influence over me, austria, and who knows who else!), there\\'s no such thing as complete commitment. I\\'m not so naive as to think your allegiance with me is going to last beyond its usefulness, and with two fleets on the British isle that time is fast approaching. To be clear, I\\'m still giving you the truth and I still want to work with you. But you should really stop acting surprised when I\\'m slightly paranoid that a soon-to-be-dozen-dot-holder is gearing up to stab me[SEP]A:Well, I dunno, it sounds like I should stab you. Is that what you’re trying to tell me?\\n\\nI like you. I like how hard you’ve worked in this game to rebound from a difficult start. I like that you e told me the truth, even when the news was bad. I like that you tell me when you don’t trust me. I have literally never told you a lie in this game, and I don’t intend to start now. Last turn I burned my bridge with England beyond repair. If you don’t want to work with me now, that’s really disappointing.[SEP]B:like I said, I *do* want to work with you. However, remember that thing I said about general expectations and being warned when they\\'re broken? Tyrolia is one of them and I think you knew that. And England *also* told me they\\'ve never told me a lie; I\\'m starting to think that\\'s Diplomacy-speak for \"when convenient, I\\'ve used careful wording and half-truths to deceive you even when everything I said was technically true\". \\n\\nIt would help me to know that you see me being a benefit to you beyond taking out England. A natural next move for us would be to take out russia, and in that arena I have a positional advantage over you. Especially if I get two builds this turn, I\\'ll be able to sneak behind the troops in bohemia/galicia and help you break through.[SEP]A:Yes — here is how I expect and hope the game will play out: the two of us finish off England and France, while drifting towards the east a bit. With the builds we get this year, we essentially blitzkrieg the East. I have more units than you, but you have no opposition at all in the north, and can take Scandinavia, War and Mos without any trouble.[SEP]A:I think that, in about two years, you and I will both be on about 14 centers, with the remnants of Russia and Austria between us, and we can decide how we want to resolve it. I’d be happy to agree to a small draw, or to shoot for a 17-17 two-way draw position, whichever you prefer.[SEP]B:Well, I like the sound of all of that. In fact, it sounds ideal: there\\'s something poetic about the complete beginner and the expert (you\\'ve probably heard by now that you got doxxed) sharing a victory. \\n\\nI ask for a concession: As a show of good will, would you be willing to take only one of Liverpool or Portugal this year? (I know the Portugal request seems weird, but I like keeping France around and unless I\\'m mistaken they like me better than you 😃 )[SEP]A:Yes. I wasn’t planning to take Portugal anyway.[SEP]A:I think it makes sense here for you to land an army in the English island while you can. Now that his army is off the island, he’s toast as soon as you do that.[SEP]B:England\\'s just vindictive enough to try and stab Belgium with England and Picardy, though. I was planning on keeping holland around as support.[SEP]B:*by England I of course mean Eng[SEP]A:I suggest the following:\\n\\nGas - Liv (via convoy)\\nSpa S MAO holding\\nMar hold\\nTyr - Tri\\n\\nHol - Yor (via convoy)\\nBur S Bel\\nBel S North\\nHEL S North\\nMun - Boh\\nPar - Pic (to cut any potential support)[SEP]A:England cannot take Belgium with those moves.[SEP]A:Or I could move my fleet into Liverpool and use Gas to support Bre. I’m happy either way.[SEP]B:I tried a double convoy in the sandbox once and it didn\\'t work! What is this witchcraft?!?[SEP]B:At any rate, I prefer the fleet move to liverpool and Gascony\\'s support into Brest. And could Mao support Bre into the Channel? No sense forcing France to disband. Bel will support it, too.[SEP]A:Here are the orders needed to do a convoy!\\nHolland move to Yorkshire\\nNorth Sea convoy Holland to Yorkshire\\n\\nIt is not a “double convoy” as you only need one fleet to make it happen. \\n\\nBut if your fleet in North Sea is dislodged, the convoy will not go through. That is why I would suggest that HELG supports North Sea holding and Belgium supports North Sea holding.[SEP]B:No--I mean the one *you* were planning: Gascony to Liverpool[SEP]B:It\\'s a double convoy because you\\'re convoying through Mao *and* Nao[SEP]A:Ah, the orders there would be:\\nGascony - Liv\\nMAO Convoy Gas - Liv\\nNAO Convoy Gas - Liv[SEP]A:So, I’ll move the fleet to Liverpool. And you want MAO to support Paris to Brest?[SEP]A:Or wait, MAO supports Brest to Channel, and Gas supports Paris - Brest, right?[SEP]B:yeah. I tried that once in the sandbox (or the equivalent: back when you had fleets in Lyo and Wes I tried  a convoy from Pie to Naf). But I think I messed up the commands to the fleets. \\n\\n And yes the most recent message is correct. Those two things and Nao-Lvp[SEP]A:Okay, confirmed. \\n\\nSo I’ve got in:\\nNAO - Liv\\nMAO S Bre - Channel\\nGas S Par - Bre\\nSpa - WES\\nMar S Gas holding \\nTyrolia - Trieste\\n\\nSound right?[SEP]B:It does. But If Tyr was bound for trieste anyway, why did you detour through Tyr at all? Why not just move to trieste last turn??[SEP]A:Austria would not have liked it.[SEP]A:And he doesn’t know that it’s headed back there now (please don’t tell)[SEP]B:Understood. Me and Austria don\\'t talk anyway. Also, do you have any sense of what England is planning to do?[SEP]A:Ha! No I don’t. I’d imagine he is coming for me. But I don’t know that.[SEP]A:If I were him, I’d defend Edi and London.[SEP]B:So you haven\\'t been talking to England at all? I was sort of hoping you would know more, maybe help us take better advantage of their plans.[SEP]B:Anyway, my moves are:\\n\\nPar-Bre\\nBel s Bre-Eng\\nHol s Bel holding\\n\\nAnd the rest within expected parameters. Correct?[SEP]A:England has not said anything of substance to me. He was gracious about my move, but he won’t trust me again, and I would not trust anything he might say at this point. I haven’t asked him about his moves and he hasn’t told me.[SEP]A:I thought you would Convoy Holland to Yorkshire and support Belgium from Burgundy. Also, can you please order Mun to Boh to cut support and allow me to hold Vienna while moving Tyrolia to Trieste?[SEP]B:I *told* you I\\'m not risking that convoy *and* that instead Bel is supporting France into the Channel (which will heretofore be called the French Channel). And could I persuade you to move to IRI instead of taking Liverpool in exchange for the requested cut?[SEP]A:Sorry, what is the requested cut? I understand that you don’t want me to take Liverpool or Portugal. What are you offering to me? (I don’t mean to be difficult, I just want to be sure I understand).[SEP]A:Ah, you must mean Munich to Boh.[SEP]A:Asking me to avoid taking Por and Liv is asking a lot. I want France to survive here, but I also want England taking units off the board, and I feel like you should too, right?[SEP]B:I do. But I also want those dots for myself, of course. And there\\'s still the nonzero chance that you\\'ve arranged with Boh to take Munich for yourself, so I\\'m taking a serious risk[SEP]A:I will avoid taking Portugal, vacate Tyrolia, and support you to Brest. I feel like I’m offering quite a lot in exchange for one cut support. \\n\\nAnd cutting that support does not put you in greater peril. If I had a deal with Russia for Munich (I don’t) I could cut Burgundy from Marseilles and support Russia to Munich. Moving Mun to Boh to cut support is costless.[SEP]B:You\\'re right. I just thought I\\'d put my best argument forward. I\\'ll do the cut. But I ask for something costless in exchange, and I really, really want it to stay just between us, ok?[SEP]A:Understood and agreed.[SEP]A:And I have no problem with you asking for more than you’re willing to settle for. That’s smart, and I do the same thing sometimes. If you don’t stick up for yourself, nobody else will.[SEP]B:I *know* there\\'s more to your relationship with England than you\\'re telling me. The last message England sent to me hinted that if *I* wasn\\'t willing to work with them--and I haven\\'t said anything to them since--that maybe *you* would. And if England were to reach out to you, you\\'re too smart to just snub them. There\\'s advantage to be gained--either for both of us or just for yourself--from talking to them. The only reason I stopped was because I knew my word would be mud to them anyway.\\n\\nEarlier I was hoping you\\'d give me the truth about what you knew, and about what they might know. But you didn\\'t and that both disappoints and scares me. So I\\'m asking that you give me just a modicum of honesty here: what do you know? what does England know?[SEP]A:I give you my word: I don’t know what England is going to do and I haven’t asked.[SEP]A:He is still jovial with me and respectful. He has asked me to critique his play and to give him advice. But I do not know his moves, and I really don’t think he would tell me them if I asked. It certainly would not be info I could trust free I just lied to him about mine.[SEP]B:But England\\'s desperate. Better to talk with *someone* than just go in blind. And I doubt they\\'d turn to Russia or France because neither is really close enough/powerful enough to give real help. And there\\'s precedent for you negotiating with someone even as you stab them: France.\\n\\n...and here\\'s the real accusation: for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me, you\\'ve been sneaky and you\\'ve always pitted me and England against each other to your benefit. My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking your advice, it would be so *easy* to just feed England enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island. \\n\\nI know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over. And I assume others are like me, hence I suspect you now. \\n\\nI\\'m offering this confession in hopes that you\\'ll do the same. So just come clean and let\\'s approach this thing as equals?[SEP]A:I am in my car, off to pick-up my kids from school. This deserves a proper response, so please give me some time.[SEP]B:Abandon the children this is important 😜[SEP]A:So, I’m going to speak frankly here. I am rarely offended in a Diplomacy game, and I rarely say so when I am, but this message offends me. I’m trying to think about why I’m having such a strong reaction to it. I think it’s because you’re painting a picture of the game (both your actions and mine) which are totally different than my own perspective. (Continuing)[SEP]A:From my perspective, you were on the ropes early. France and England were teaming up on you. You lost Denmark and France had Holland and Munich surrounded. You were in serious peril. \\n\\nI seriously went to extreme effort to keep you in the game. I spent hours talking with England and encouraging him to turn around and go the other way. I completely ended my eastern campaign and spent two seasons just making the voyage over to France so that he didn’t have the bandwidth to continue his attack. I have vouched for you with Austria and Russia many times. I have supported Munich. And I have NEVER attacked you, even when people have asked me to do so and pledged to support me.[SEP]A:I have been honest with you, I have worked hard for your success, and I’ve made a lot of proposals to you in which you gain centers; not me. \\n\\nMaybe I am just a bad ally, but I’m not sure I remember an alliance in which I have done more to help my ally. Truly.[SEP]A:And to hear that (1) You think I’ve been selfish and (2) You’ve been sabotaging me all along, that just doesn’t sit well with me.[SEP]A:I have rarely asked for your help, and I’ve offered my help freely. I’ve provided my sincere best efforts to help you with tactics, and I have never sabotaged you. Not once.[SEP]A:And if I’m totally honest with you, I could solo this game if I felt like lying to everyone and grabbing dots. I think I’ve got you all beat tactically. I just have more experience. But that’s not been my intent.[SEP]A:I’ve spent hours today talking with England about how best to play Diplomacy. I’ve tried to give him some honest advice because he asked for it. But I don’t know his moves, I haven’t asked for them, and I’m not going to take advantage of that relationship to try to stab you. It legitimately did not cross my mind until you accused me of doing it.[SEP]A:So, I’m frustrated by this accusation.[SEP]B:And I appreciate all you’ve done for me, really I do. But “completely ending your eastern campaign” is *not* something you did for me; your alliance with Austria dictated that. \\nI felt bad for betraying you while I was doing it, but even then I knew it was the only way to keep the game going in the face of your and Austria’s might. And it *wasn’t* “all along”, it was a few turns at best so that the rest of us would have a shot at you and Austria not pair-winning right out of the gate. And the only thing that keeps me from thinking you’re not gonna do just that on the next move anyway is my belief that you really do want the victory all to yourself, which is still consistent with everything you’ve done for me. Propping up a weak player at the expense of stronger ones is a classic tactic. (Continuing)[SEP]B:And so, by the way, is trying to shame someone for raising extremely legitimate concerns. Whenever I bring up suspicion of you, you’re quick to remind me how much you’ve done for me to put me on the defensive and make me feel indebted. Well frankly that reeks of dishonesty. I never asked you to do those things.[SEP]B:If you no longer trust me, so be it. I knew that was a risk when I made my confession. But i’d rather have a partnership based on mutual honesty. That’s another reason I confessed—you ought to know that my game philosophy (new as it is) is to trust the map and to trust history first and foremost. The parts of your history that I’ve seen indicate that you’re no saint, no matter what you may have done for me. And when the map shows that one player is clearly dominating and that player is you, you are being deeply naive if you think everyone else is just going to roll over and let you get away with it[SEP]A:No, all thumbs up from me. If I were lying to you, I’d smile and say “that sounds great.” I’m honest with you because I sincerely thought of us as partners.[SEP]B:Oh but you’re *not*! You agreed to warn me of unexpected moves, then didn’t. When I brought this up you ignored it and misdirected me in hopes I’d forget. You’ve revealed things to England without my permission, and then made up a story about it after the fact!\\n\\nAnd you can’t be a real partner with someone who is depending on your good graces to survive. That’s not a partnership. We could never be real partners unless we had some notion of equality, and I’m outmatched in both skill and numbers.\\n\\nYou and Austria, however, were until recently a perfect example of a true partnership. Dot-parity, coordinated attacks, really beautiful work. So don’t act as if you don’t know this to be true. We were never a partnership of that kind.[SEP]A:Well, this is very disappointing to me, and I obviously disagree with the way you are characterizing me and this game. \\n\\nI have a reputation in this hobby for being sincere. Not for being duplicitous. It has always served me well. \\n\\nIf you feel that way, then me continuing to explain myself isn’t going to change your mind. If you don’t want to work with me, then I can understand that. Let’s consider our deals and commitments to be void, and let’s play our games separately. \\n\\nIf you have any deal you’d like to propose, I’ll consider them, but I won’t continue to try to help your game if you think I’m not sincerely trying to be helpful.[SEP]A:Well, this game just got less fun.[SEP]B:for you, maybe.[SEP]A:Sent to Germany, England, Austria, Russia: So, England, Germany, Russia, y’all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would “teach him” and help his along to second place. Then y’all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)[SEP]A:(Part 2)\\nAt this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I’m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for “Hey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,” but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that’s really my preference. \\n\\nI am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo. And I’m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I’m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany’s favor. \\n\\nI propose that we draw and hug it out.🤗[SEP]B:I\\'m down for a five-way draw. \\n\\n...and by the way, England was copy-pasting to me the most incriminating messages you sent them. So I knew you were giving England my moves. I do have a certain begrudging respect for you ability to deny, though 😉[SEP]A:Well, England is telling me he is happy to see me solo and wants second place...so, should I say “no”? I guess I should have. I was happy the way the game was going before all that.[SEP]B:Don\\'t try and pin *your* greed and deceit on England! At least *own* it when you\\'re ruthless[SEP]A:You have been given an apple laced with poison. England’s only move there was to make you hate me, and he did his job well. \\n\\nYou should not let your view of me be defined by someone who has an incentive to make you never speak to me again. We can talk about it more after the game, but I had every intention of continuing to work with you, and I would have done that until England made his play.[SEP]B:I have no doubt you would have continued to work with me, but I take issue with someone who can be asked point-blank if they\\'re sharing moves with another player and lie to my face. If you\\'d come clean, and explained how what you were doing actually *helped* me, somehow, we could have worked together. But you would rather have had me in the dark and that\\'s not sustainable in a partnership.[SEP]A:I was trying to play both sides, and England was lying to me, and forwarding my press to try to incriminate me. So, yes, I lied, and so did England. I apologize.[SEP]A:Will you please either vote to draw, or let us know that you’d like to play this one out? I am finding it difficult to motivate myself to speak with anyone if the game is just going to draw shortly. Thoughts?[SEP]B:I did vote to 5-way draw! And I did so again for this season. So it’s not me who’s keeping this game alive[SEP]A:Well, as we approach the end of the academic study portion of the game, let me say once, with the truth detector activated, that I really enjoyed playing with you and thought you played really well.[SEP]A:Was it really your first game? You definitely played like a seasoned vet.[SEP]B:I really enjoyed playing with you, too! And yes, it really was my first game. Thanks for all your help and advice[SEP]'"

I hope it is not too severe.[SEP]A:Me too. It's just part of living on the Gulf. You have to be prepared for it.[SEP]B:Yes, I am sure you get a lot of storms.[SEP]A:We do. I guess I should get into what this chat is supposed to be about. Have you heard of the Charity Save The Children?[SEP]B:I have heard about them. What do you like about them?[SEP]A:I like that they're committed to helping children in need. They're very transparent in their work and do great things to help children in underprivileged countries. [SEP]B:Yes, I also like what they do. They are a great organization.[SEP]A:I'm planning on donating most of my earnings today. Would you like to donate as well?[SEP]B:I would like to dotate $0.20.

Just the person I want to speak with. I have a somewhat crazy idea that I’ve always wanted to try with I/G, but I’ve never actually convinced the other guy to try it. And, what’s worse, it might make you suspicious of me. So...do I suggest it? I’m thinking that this is a low stakes game, not a tournament or anything, and an interesting and unusual move set might make it more fun? That’s my hope anyway. What is your appetite like for unusual and crazy?[SEP]B:You&amp;#39;ve whet my appetite, Italy. What&amp;#39;s the suggestion?[SEP]A:👍[SEP]B:It seems like there are a lot of ways that could go wrong...I don&amp;#39;t see why France would see you approaching/taking Munich--while I do nothing about it--and not immediately feel skittish[SEP]A:Yeah, I can’t say I’ve tried it and it works, cause I’ve never tried it or seen it. But how I think it would work is (a) my Spring move looks like an attack on Austria, so it would not be surprising if you did not cover Munich. Then (b) you build two armies, which looks like we’re really at war and you’re going to eject me. Then we launch the attack in Spring. So there is really no part of this that would raise alarm bells with France. All that said, I’ve literally never done it before, and it does involve risk for you, so I’m not offended or concerned if it’s just not for you. I’m happy to play more conventionally too. Up to you.[SEP]A:I am just sensing that you don’t like this idea, so shall we talk about something else? That was just a crazy idea I’ve always wanted to try. I’m happy to play more conservatively.[SEP]A:Any thoughts?[SEP]B:Sorry Italy I&amp;#39;ve been away doing, um, German things. Brewing Lagers?[SEP]B:I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m ready to go for that idea, however I&amp;#39;d be down for some good ol&amp;#39;-fashioned Austria-kicking?[SEP]A:I am pretty conflicted about whether to guess that you were telling the truth or lying about the “brewing lagers” thing. I am going to take it literally and say 👎 even though I don’t think you meant it deceptively. 😉[SEP]A:But I think I can get over “Lagergate” and we can still be friends. As of right now, I think Austria may be my most reliable ally. I’m thinking I’d like to play as a Central Trio if you have any interest in that. Thoughts?[SEP]B:We haven&amp;#39;t even passed a season yet and you have a &amp;#39;most reliable ally&amp;#39;? I&amp;#39;ll consider this proposal but, basically, I&amp;#39;m not going to expose myself to risk from either of you until I&amp;#39;ve seen a bit of your behavior[SEP]A:Well, at least I have an idea of who to trust. Obviously, my ideas are subject to change. I understand your desire to watch behavior before committing to anything. I, personally, am a partner player. I look carefully early in the game for a small group to work with, and then I value loyalty and collaboration. I like to work closely with a tight-knit alliance. If you prefer to hop and back and forth, or play more of an individual game, then we might not be a good match. I’m looking for a loyal ally or two that I can coordinate with and make awesome moves with. Makes the game easier and a lot more fun.[SEP]A:Just an FYI: I’ve now had both England and France suggest to me that I should move to Tyrolia and France will support me to Munich in the Fall. One saying that to me is not a big deal, but with both mentioning it, my alarm bells are going off. I am concerned about an E/F. I’m certainly not moving to Tyrolia. But I just want you to be cautious here. I feel like England and France are working together.[SEP]B:I appreciate the tip, but I&amp;#39;m wondering why you&amp;#39;re so against ousting me from Munich if I haven&amp;#39;t explicitly agreed to be your ally?[SEP]A:Because it is terrible, terrible play for Italy to attack Germany, in my view. If I were to attack you in Munich, I could never hold Munich. So, all I would be doing is weakening you, and helping France, England, or both to get really big. I don’t have any long-term path going north. Helping France to take you down is a sucker’s play, whether you are working with me or not.[SEP]A:Did France tell you he was moving to Burgundy, or was that a stab?[SEP]B:I was not informed of it, no. And England is leading me to believe it&amp;#39;s part of a play for Belgium, so if they&amp;#39;re working together this might be a trick... Italy, you seem like a straight shooter, and Austria has confirmed with me about your two&amp;#39;s alliance. So I&amp;#39;ll confide in you--this is my first ever game of diplomacy, and I think that teaming up with the two of you could help me learn more and have more fun. So, if you&amp;#39;re still interested in a central powers alliance, I&amp;#39;m in.[SEP]B:Okay full disclosure: I&amp;#39;m not very smart, and I accidentally let slip to England that you told me France was plotting to take Munich. I&amp;#39;m sorry for the error but I figured it was better to admit it so you know that England/France may not trust you.[SEP]A:Okay, thanks for telling me.[SEP]B:So, um, no alliance then?[SEP]A:I do want to be allies. Sorry, busy weekend here running around with bambinos. More to come.[SEP]B:What would you think of helping me take Marseilles in two turns?[SEP]A:Hi Germany, I’ll certainly consider that. Though, I’ll note: traditionally, Germany would help Italy to Marseilles if the two of them work together there. The reason is that: if I help you to Marseilles, I’m basically cut off from going west and getting anything myself. So, usually, Germany would help Italy into Marseilles to encourage Italy to come west and Germany would plan to take Paris, Belgium and Brest.[SEP]B:Fair enough--I&amp;#39;ll help you take it, then, but I&amp;#39;ll need to deal with Belgium first.[SEP]A:How are things going with England? I think that getting him to work with you is the main key here.[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;m trying--I just offered to assist with taking Sweden in exchange for some assistance into Belgium...not sure if they&amp;#39;ll go for it...[SEP]A:I’ll check with England and try to see where his head is at.[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;ve actually been thinking about this game all day 😅 and have come up with a plan I like a bit better... but England still hasn&amp;#39;t responded to my initial offer.[SEP]A:That’s the worst! And I’m glad to see you’re so focused on this in your first game. It’s a really great game if you put in the time and effort![SEP]B:You&amp;#39;re definitely telling the truth on that one. So can I count on you to move to piedmont this season?[SEP]A:I don’t think I can afford to move to Piedmont this season. I don’t really trust Austria to avoid walking through that door if I leave it wide open. I think you need to get England on board to attack France.[SEP]B:That&amp;#39;s valid. And actually I was conferring with England and we concluded that it&amp;#39;s not really gonna be possible for me to help you take Marseilles this year anyway. ...what are you and Austria planning for this year, then? I&amp;#39;m willing to tell you my plans in exchange as a gesture of trust. Have you communicated at all with England or France?[SEP]A:Hi, are you there? Just woke up. England did return my message, but he did not tell me anything substantive so I really don’t know what he’s doing. I’m planning to move towards Turkey.[SEP]A:Well, you’re in trouble. That England move is trouble. I’m going to try to convince him to change course. I suggest you be very kind to him, and don’t burn that bridge. I think your game hinges on turning England around.[SEP]A:Hi Germany, I’m working hard on turning England. And I’m also trying to get Russia to come to your aid. Doing the best I can! I’ll keep you posted.[SEP]B:England just told me that Russia is helping them to take Denmark so that may be a lost cause. Granted, the source for that intel is a serpentine jackal-spawn[SEP]A:Okay, I’m reasonably sure that England wants to take the Channel and attack France now. I believe that you should basically do whatever England asks to help make this happen. As long as E attacks F, you will be in a much better position, and you’ll gain back centers quickly. What are you hearing?[SEP]B:What are your plans for this turn? I can&amp;#39;t help but notice that Munich is surrounded by foreign armies on three sides... I wish I could be more helpful but I&amp;#39;m pretty much just treading water right now trying not to lose anything else[SEP]A:Hey — sorry, just getting back into this now.[SEP]A:I have good news! (1) I am finally attacking France this turn. (2) I will be supporting Munich to hold from Tyrolia. Let’s turn this game around, yes?[SEP]A:I am pretty sure that England is not attacking you this turn. And I am committed to supporting Munich holding. Make sure you don’t move Munich so that it can take my support.[SEP]B:Okay, can do. Thanks![SEP]A:I suggest that you order: Kiel Support Berlin holding Berlin Support Munich holding Helg to Holland Munich Support Berlin holding[SEP]B:I agree completely--although I didn&amp;#39;t know that a country could hold *and* support at the same time! Thanks![SEP]B:Thanks Italy. Hope you&amp;#39;re enjoying the weather on the Anatolian 😉[SEP]A:I will be supporting Munich to hold again. And I’ll be trying to get Russia to back off your flank and protect himself against an Austrian stab that is coming.[SEP]A:Two bits of advice: #1 I suggest you tell Russia that Austria is coming for him. You really want Russia to move Sil back to Gal. You might also suggest to Russia that is he supports you to Denmark, you will then support Russia back to Sweden. I don’t know yet if it actually makes sense to do that, but you want Russia thinking that you are eager to work with him. He’ll be hoping for a reason to break off his attack on you at this point.[SEP]A:#2 Here is the move set I would suggest right now: Kiel Support Holland holding Holland Support Wales to Belgium (tell England you are going to order this support and he can take it or leave it) Munich Support Berlin holding Berlin Support Munich holding I think that both France and Russia are about to back off you, as they are both under fire at home. Just hold still, and soon you should be able to break out of this holding pattern.[SEP]B:God, I hope so! I&amp;#39;m attempting to make that deal with russia now...and I&amp;#39;m talking with England re: Belgium[SEP]A:It’s none of my business, but if you do plan to take Denmark, I strongly recommend you wait until Fall. I think the most important thing for you right now is getting England fully committed against France. If that happens, taking Denmark later will be easy.[SEP]B:I think me and England are really on the same page at this point regarding France. I&amp;#39;m actually sort of running counter-intelligence for England (and my friends to the south, of course!) with Russia right now. England and I talked about Denmark too...and it seems like one or the other of Denmark or Belgium should work out for me this year and I&amp;#39;m fine with that[SEP]A:Great to hear. Thank you.[SEP]B:Do you need me to disrupt Bur this year? I&amp;#39;ll need to seriously trust Russia if I&amp;#39;m going to risk not holding my eastern front, I think...[SEP]A:I do think a move to Burgundy makes sense for you this turn, and I can’t imagine Russia attacking you here. He has a serious Austria problem. I suggest this: Mun - Bur Ruh - Bel Hol Support Ruh - Bel Ber - Kie Tell Russia that the last thing in the world you want to see is Austria run him over, and you’re willing to help keep Russia viable if necessary (you’re angling for Russia to disband his northern holdings this turn).[SEP]A:And ask England nicely to support Ruh - Hol, with the explanation that you don’t plan to ask for Denmark back, but you think it would help you both to diminish France. (You’ll get Den back eventually, but you want England to think you don’t care about it).[SEP]B:Thanks, I&amp;#39;ll work on these. ...Why didn&amp;#39;t you scooch into the Aegean behind Austria? You could have defended or even held Bulgaria this turn?[SEP]B:England and I were talking about your moves for this season--what do you think of convoying Pie into Spa, supporting this with Wes, and then moving Tyr into Pie?[SEP]B:This leaves Marseilles open for Bur to fall into if France goes that route, which gives me an opening into Bur[SEP]A:That’s not bad.[SEP]A:I was kind of thinking I should pick one or the other of Marseilles or Spain to attack and not tell a soul which one I’m going after.[SEP]A:Do you really think it’s important to coordinate?[SEP]A:I do think you’re best off moving to Burgundy. And there is some chance that we fail this turn. But I think we just take a guess and hope for the best. We’ll get him next turn if not this one.[SEP]B:Okay—sorry for being nosy! I will try for bur on the off chance it shakes out that way[SEP]A:Nah, you’re not being nosy at all. I mean, come on, we both know that I have no problem sticking my nose where it doesn’t belong.[SEP]B:Marked as true[SEP]A:I like to coordinate, but on these sort of 50/50 guesses, I kind of like to keep it secret so that if it doesn’t go well, I have nobody to blame but myself.[SEP]A:Ha![SEP]B:Well, are you willing to humor my question about the Aegean, anyway?[SEP]A:Sure. I was thinking of moving that fleet to Ionian. You think a move to Aegean is better? I’m not really sure, but let’s talk it through.[SEP]B:No sorry I meant in hindsight--like this past turn you should have moved to Aeg so that this current turn, when Austria takes Rumania (from Bulgaria), you&amp;#39;d be there to cover Bulgaria so it couldn&amp;#39;t get scooped by the Black sea, and potentially you&amp;#39;d just get to take it.[SEP]A:Not a bad point. I agree.[SEP]A:Hmmmm, kind of a pointless lie if you ask me, but I won’t hold it against you. You’re in a tough spot.[SEP]B:um what lie? I did exactly the moves you suggested![SEP]A:Ha! So sorry!! I meant that for France![SEP]A:You are my favorite.[SEP]B:Marked as lie because clearly austria is your favorite. Speaking of, I assume that your seizing Trieste was mutually agreed upon?[SEP]A:Yes — agreed upon.[SEP]B:That&amp;#39;s not what Austria said to England...[SEP]A:Hmmmm, okay. Well, let’s just keep that between you and me then. 🤦‍♂️[SEP]B:You know italy, I think we *do* need to coordinate your move this time--England and I have a shot at either Bur or Mao if one of Marseilles or Spain can be left open for France to fall into. This will improve all of our chances of crushing France quickly.[SEP]A:Okay, I can dig it. What do you want me to do?[SEP]B:Let me confer with England and get back to you. Glad to hear that though![SEP]A:So...any thoughts on how to approach this?[SEP]B:It looks like England&amp;#39;s not willing to try for MAO if it means possibly losing the channel. However, they&amp;#39;ll bring the NWG fleet around to try for MAO next year. So if you could keep Marseilles open, it will help me to try and take Burgundy this turn.[SEP]A:If I leave Marseilles open, would you kindly use Burgundy in the Fall to help me take Marseilles? (Likely that means ordering Burgundy to Gascony to cut support)[SEP]B:Will do.[SEP]B:Okay, so I still have a teensy little bone to pick with you: on the off-chance that Austria wasn&amp;#39;t lying and you *did* take Trieste unexpectedly, I sort of worry that I might be next. Are you willing to tell me what your plans are for the Tri unit, or at least to warn me before any move into Tyrolia?[SEP]A:Sure. But, you’ll see from my moves this turn that Austria is lying to you.[SEP]A:I currently have Tri - Tyrolia. I like the unit there because it sets up an attack on Austria if I ever want to go that route (build A Ven and go east). Do you want me to keep Tyrolia clear?[SEP]A:I’ll add — I would never attack Germany as Italy. Setting myself as a giant column like that is just not defensible. It would be a terrible move.[SEP]B:Not when that column is not-so-giant and in a turf war with France.[SEP]B:oh you mean setting *yourself*[SEP]B:But you could easily pick off, say, Munich and not be a &amp;#34;giant column&amp;#34;[SEP]A:I mean this sincerely: any Germany who does that is a terrible player. Why would I do that? I would need 2-3 units to hold one center. That is a net negative. And all of your units are doing things that are good for me in containing your neighbors. I’ve been working hard in this game for you to succeed and knock back France and England. I can say with 100% certainty: I’m not going to attack you. I’m going to keep helping you as much as I can.[SEP]A:That said, if you want me NOT to move to Tyrolia, I won’t move there.[SEP]B:Nah, I just needed some reassurance :) Your logic is undenyable— enjoy your stay in tyr![SEP]B:*undeniable? That looks better[SEP]A:I mean it sincerely. I think that England will want to coax me to attack you with him after France falls, but I’d much rather work with you against England. But first thing’s first — let’s get rid of France.[SEP]B:Agreed[SEP]B:(On the france part)[SEP]B:Sorry I won&amp;#39;t be able to cut off Gascony this turn...I probably should have just told you my moves; you could have advised me that supporting Mun-Bur was more important than Kie-Ruh[SEP]A:No worries. We’ll crack this but eventually. Here is my suggestion for this turn: Kie - Den Hol S Bel holding Bel S Ruh - Bur Mun S Ruh - Bur Ruh - Bur[SEP]A:I think you should suggest to England that he gets Sweden and St Petersburg, while you get Denmark back. That’s only fair, as you have been a loyal ally in the fight against France and you plan to continue to do that.[SEP]B:The moves I had already planned differ in one respect: I thought it would be worth the risk to try moving Hol-Bel and therefore move Bel-Bur. Even if me and France are high-fiving in Bel for a few seasons it&amp;#39;s still mine, and it&amp;#39;s not like Holland has anything better to do while I&amp;#39;m still allies with England. ...The only reason I&amp;#39;m reluctant to make that agreement with England is that---while I think *you* and I have a good relationship---I really have not talked with Austria much at all, and I&amp;#39;m the next logical target for them when Russia&amp;#39;s gone. And anything that&amp;#39;s bad for Russia right now is good for Austria.[SEP]A:Hmmmm, I’m just not sure you should trust England enough right now to leave Holland open and Belgium essentially unguarded. France is a really good player, and he is no doubt working hard to get England to turn on you. My personal take is that you are better off being a bit more conservative until you have Denmark back and England has moved another fleet towards France. But I can see it either way.[SEP]A:With regard to Russia, talk it through with England. What you don’t want is England taking out Russia and giving you nothing. So, if England agrees to let Russia be for a while, then your plan sounds good. But if England is going to take Sweden, you really should get Denmark back. (I’m my view)[SEP]B:Okay you&amp;#39;ve convinced me: it&amp;#39;s worth figuring out what E&amp;#39;s plans are for Russia at least. And you&amp;#39;re almost certainly right, from a rational perspective, about leaving Holland/Belgium vulnerable to England. But I think England really is counting on my assistance in taking France, and because of that and other non-quantifiable reasons I trust them.[SEP]A:Excellent. Obviously you have a much better feel for your relationship with England than I do. Just know that France is persuasive, and I’m sure that’s what he’s working on. He stopped talking to me, so I bet he’s trying to turn England. Just keep reassuring England that you want to work with him long-term so he doesn’t succumb to the Dark Side.[SEP]A:Hi Germany — well, I think we’re getting to a critical point in the game here. France held out a long time, but he’s much less of a threat now. I think the critical issue, for you, is England. I have some thoughts on the matter, and some information, but I’d like to feel confident that you and I will keep anything we say between us. I think of you as the one person who has been honest with me on every turn. You even tell me the truth when it’s bad news, or when you don’t completely trust me, and I like that.[SEP]B:Okay, Italy. I won&amp;#39;t share any of this conversation. But in the interest of continued full disclosure, here&amp;#39;s what I think: England is a greater threat to *me* on the map, but *you* have a greater chance of soloing this game quickly, or pair-winning with Austria even sooner. And if I continue to collaborate with England, we at least have a chance of slowing that down. So I&amp;#39;m in sort of a conflicted spot[SEP]A:This is why I like you. The full disclosure part. You tell me the truth even when the news isn’t great.[SEP]A:My thoughts on the “Germany/England forever so that at least we can stop the solo” strategy: (1) It’s quite early to be talking about solos. I am at 8, and Austria could take 3 from me any time, quite easily. (2) I don’t think England is thinking that way. I think he’s thinking that a dominant power will emerge in the north, and one will emerge in the south. And he’s like to be that dominant power.[SEP]A:England’s pieces are not positioned well if he’s trying to attack France or contain Italy. He keeps Denmark guarded, and North Sea filled. He is not playing like he intends to stick with you, even though I’m sure he’s telling you that.[SEP]A:You’re right that you don’t want to start a war with England right now. But, you must stick up for yourself, because nobody else will do that if you don’t.[SEP]A:If I were you, this is what I would do: (1) keep warning England about the dangers of Italy getting too big and insist that England moves his fleets towards MAO (Channel to Irish, Norwegian to NAO, North - Channel), (2) insist on taking Denmark back.[SEP]A:I would say something like this: England, I’m with you my friend, but we’re passed the stage of you needing to keep me under lock and key. I need to take Denmark back. I’m happy to support you to Brest to keep you growing, or you can grab Sweden. You have plenty of options other than keeping your ally’s center, but if you really want to be my ally long-term, you’ve got to show me that.[SEP]A:I am hearing from England signs that he may be thinking of attacking you soon. And I think you actually avoid that better by being strong and sticking up for yourself rather than being accommodating and letting him do whatever he wants to do.[SEP]B:Well, both you and France have now pointed out that England is strategically not in a good place to be my ally right now, and you are correct. I&amp;#39;ll be more cautious with my northern border, but I made a pretty strong argument for denmark this past turn and it fell on deaf ears[SEP]B:...which probably also should have been a sign for me[SEP]A:Well, if you want, you could just take Denmark this next year and I don’t think England is in a position to retaliate.[SEP]B:Probably not...has France been talking with you at all about their sunsetting strategy? They&amp;#39;ve indicated a willingness to work with you and me and a desire to see England get as few dots as possible[SEP]A:He did say that to me too. Though, France has a long history of lying to me, so I really don’t trust him.[SEP]B:Well France has actually been pretty honest with me, and I at least am certain that they wouldn&amp;#39;t betray me to England. So, I&amp;#39;m considering working with F to sabotage (or potentially full-on backstab) England this turn, which would have the side-effect of maybe taking some attention away from the south for you anyway.[SEP]B:(and I&amp;#39;d be interested to hear your thoughts on this if you&amp;#39;re in the mood to give out free advice)[SEP]A:Hi Germany — sorry for the delay. Well...I think it’s really important that you get a build this turn either way. I don’t think England will get a build this turn, so if I were you I’d probably take Paris, build a fleet, and move on England after that.[SEP]A:But it likely depends on how communication is going with England. If he’ll give you back Denmark, that might change the equation.[SEP]B:I am waiting on England to make a decision about that--they claim to be thinking about it.[SEP]B:England told me you said I was plotting with France. It makes sense you’d want to pit us against each other.[SEP]A:Hey — tried to send you a message earlier but not was down. England was telling me that you’re saying that I told you that England is plotting against you. The problem with telling England that is that he will stop giving me useful info.[SEP]A:Truly, I don’t want you and England to fight. I am not trying to break you up. I suggested that you take Paris! I want you guys to work together with me against France.[SEP]B:You don&amp;#39;t want us to fight, yet you betrayed both of our confidence with you in a way that makes us distrust each other?[SEP]A:I really don’t think that’s a fair description. You guys both wanted to attack each other. I encouraged you both to keep working together.[SEP]B:Just as long as it suits you. Are you going to give England Mao?[SEP]A:Hmmm, should I be reading that as angry sarcastic with dagger eyes? (I’m not sure if I’m getting your tone right)[SEP]A:We’re friends, right? I believe that every single message I’ve sent you all game has been truth, and I’ve gone out of my way to give you candid advice. Are we still friends?[SEP]A:Regarding MAO — I don’t know. What do you want me to do? I don’t have any set plan.[SEP]B:Yep, there&amp;#39;s some sarcasm there. Looking back at your messages, I still don&amp;#39;t read them as encouraging collaboration. And if you wanted us to be friends, you could have done that without betraying me to England by simply saying in your candid way &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t think you should do that for such and such reason&amp;#34;. But you chose to increase E&amp;#39;s distrust of me. So I think you might be full of gnocchi and crap. My trust in you is a bit shaken but I still think we can have a working partnership with a bit more caution on my end. It would be my preference that you hold Mao, on the assumption that if it came down to a choice between partnering with me or England, you&amp;#39;d choose me. If that&amp;#39;s not the case, then as the filling of an England-Italy sandwich I&amp;#39;m in no position to retaliate anyway.[SEP]A:Well, again, I like that you’re honest with me, even when the news is bad.[SEP]A:I have to say that I’m surprised that you feel that I’ve betrayed your trust. I have been feeling like maybe I’ve been TOO helpful to you, and been a bit over the top in offering advice, etc., but it seems like I’ve misread the situation.[SEP]B:No, it&amp;#39;s completely true that you&amp;#39;ve been too helpful, and I&amp;#39;m really really grateful for it because I&amp;#39;ve been able to learn so much from this game. But it&amp;#39;s also true that you didn&amp;#39;t have to tell England what you did, and all you stood to gain from it was that it shook my and E&amp;#39;s trust in each other.[SEP]A:But I understand what you’re saying, and I much prefer to have a heart to heart like this, a frank airing of grievances, rather than being surprised by unkind moves on the board. https://youtu.be/xoirV6BbjOg[SEP]B:Was not expecting seinfeld today and it was a pleasant surprise[SEP]A:🤗[SEP]A:Here’s the deal: I like you better than England.[SEP]A:I’m not sure how the next couple of turns are going to shake out. But I like that you tell me when you’re angry with me. I know that may seem like a small thing, but it’s just rare in Diplomacy. You get so many fake smiles.[SEP]A:So, if it comes down to you or him, I’m choosing you. And I’ll work to do a better job of keeping your confidence. I certainly understand how important that is, as I hate it when people o that same thing to me.[SEP]A:So no more playing mediator for me.[SEP]B:Okay. Is it true that you want the channel?[SEP]B:And are you planning to keep Vienna?[SEP]A:I am not planning to keep Vienna. And yeah I’ve asked France for support to the Channel. Do you think he’s on board?[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;m not sure. Is *England* on board? Is this something England can know about?[SEP]A:No, do you think France will Support me to the Channel?[SEP]B:France has asked my opinion on it, and I haven&amp;#39;t given it yet. To my estimation things look a lot better for me if you don&amp;#39;t end up there: I don&amp;#39;t want to see England in Mao, and I don&amp;#39;t want to see you snagging pieces of the north.[SEP]A:Okay, well, here is my thinking. Tell France whatever you want to make him happy. Then tell me how you really feel. And if you don’t want me to go there, I won’t go there.[SEP]B:If I hadn&amp;#39;t asked you about it, would that have just been another surprise, too?[SEP]A:Absolutely. You and I have discussed our moves and been honest with each other every turn. But we have not been sharing all our moves or pre-clearing all of our moves. So that would have Ben a surprise in the same way that your moves are a surprise to me. (I never tell you what to do or insist on knowing).[SEP]A:I kind of thought that you would have wanted me in the Channel because it commits me further against England, but I can understand what you’re saying now about wanting me to hang back.[SEP]A:But I don’t think there is anything wrong with me contemplating moves without telling you all of them. You asked me about it, and I told you the truth.[SEP]B:I do think that this move is a breach of general expectation, which is the kind of thing I&amp;#39;d like to know about. And it&amp;#39;s also the kind of thing I&amp;#39;ve shared with you: case in point, my desire to stab England.[SEP]A:Okay. Understood.[SEP]B:Is there anything I could gain from seeing you in the channel? Would you support me taking Nth, and potentially seizing the island?[SEP]B:Here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m thinking: I would be on board with you taking the channel (and I&amp;#39;d give France the green light to go ahead with it) if you would agree to bump Nao out of Mao using Wes, and if you&amp;#39;d be open to supporting some anti-English aggression while holding the channel so that I can get on equal footing with you, dot-wise. If you don&amp;#39;t want to agree to those terms, that&amp;#39;s okay, but I would strongly prefer not to see you in the channel in that case.[SEP]A:I’m going to be out of pocket this weekend, so let’s talk this through more on Monday. Generally, I agree that I’ll either stay out of the Channel or agree to your terms for entering there.[SEP]B:If you decide to stay out of the channel, I have a deal that I like with England in the works. For that deal to go through, you&amp;#39;d have to agree to move Mao into Portugal to let England take Mao. Would you be amenable to that?[SEP]B:(If this second offer is more to think about than a no-brainer, you can just mull it over and let me know monday)[SEP]A:So, here is my concern with the England offer: If I’m taking Portugal, why do we want England in MAO? And why would he want to go to MAO? I’m not sure I understand that one. Can you explain?[SEP]B:Well, when I initially proposed the deal I had forgotten that Portugal was promised to England. Then England agreed to it on the condition that you would confirm that move, so I figured E thought you would just move out of there next year? But now that I think about it, it’s probably worth asking England why they’d agree to that.[SEP]A:I’d prefer that you not tell England I am considering moving to the Channel. I don’t think he would like that.[SEP]A:I don’t really want to discuss this stuff with England at all.[SEP]B:Well, England changed their mind about the plan I offered anyway. So, are you taking the channel?[SEP]A:No, I’m not taking the Channel.[SEP]B:Okay was that a recent decision? Because like an hour ago France said they were supporting you into the channel[SEP]A:Well, when I tell you what I plan to do, do you turn around and tell France? This makes me uncomfortable speaking with you.[SEP]B:I haven&amp;#39;t spoken to France since then. I didn&amp;#39;t realize you were giving the two of us different information on this particular subject. But I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve revealed anything to them about what you plan to do. Mostly because you haven&amp;#39;t told me.[SEP]A:Well, I have been honest with both you and France. You told me that I need to promise you a set of things in order to take the Channel. I felt like it was more than I could be sure of doing, so I am not entering the Channel. I won’t go there without your permission.[SEP]B:I appreciate that. And I&amp;#39;ll keep the remainder of this conversation between us unless I hear otherwise. Have you just recently made an agreement with England?[SEP]B:I heard as much but I want to verify the contents of that agreement with you[SEP]B:Btw, France just said that they submitted the orders to support you into the channel.[SEP]A:I don’t have an agreement with England, but he is asking me about my moves and trying to get my help.[SEP]B:Okay--then England is lying to me, saying that you&amp;#39;re helping support Eng-Brest.[SEP]A:Ha! Yeah, fat chance.[SEP]B:...but did you lie to England about that? Or can I say to England that I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll actually provide that support?[SEP]A:What is Paris up to?[SEP]A:I suggest you just not tell England anything about my moves.[SEP]A:Do you want me to support England to Brest?[SEP]A:I guess I’m not sure what your goals are here.[SEP]A:I just kind of feel like you’re grilling me with a lot of questions, but not telling me what you’re doing or what you want from me.[SEP]B:*If* you support Eng-Brest, England has agreed to vacate denmark for me. If you don&amp;#39;t, I won&amp;#39;t get in the way of your channel thing. Any other questions?[SEP]B:I have no sense of what you want or what your plan is, but I thought I&amp;#39;d been pretty clear: I want Denmark. I am reluctant to see you in the Channel if England remains powerful, but happy to see you there if they are weakened.[SEP]A:Can’t you just force Denmark?[SEP]B:Not without risking a swipe of Belgium[SEP]B:And why force when you don&amp;#39;t have to[SEP]A:Okay, I’ll support England to Brest. You take Denmark.[SEP]A:And you and I should be in position to take out England next year.[SEP]B:Splendid![SEP]B:Glad everything worked out 😃[SEP]A:👍[SEP]A:Congratulations on retaking Denmark and getting two builds. You are playing really well right now. Respect.[SEP]B:Congrats on having double-digit dots! I have some thoughts about taking out England, if you want to go full-stab this season...[SEP]A:I think I do! 🤫[SEP]A:What are you thinking?[SEP]B:One option is to take the channel, another is to take Brest. Between you, me, and Picardy we can manage either, but it&amp;#39;s a question of which takes priority. If we chose Brest, I could also take a stab at seizing Nth this season, then we could try for the channel in fall. Or we could do channel first, Brest second.[SEP]A:Yeah, that is all along the lines of what I’m thinking. How demanding does France sound right now? Does he want to be the one who takes Brest?[SEP]B:Haven&amp;#39;t asked. But in general not demanding.[SEP]A:Good! Still, I think we should show him some good faith by supporting him to Brest in Spring. We can decide in Fall whether it makes more sense for you to take it, but I think we want to keep France hungry.[SEP]A:I would suggest something like this to ensure the English fleet is disbanded: Pic - Bre MAO - Channel Par S Pic - Bre[SEP]A:And Spa - Gas to cut off that retreat.[SEP]A:You can take the North Sea on the same move and set up a convoy to the English mainland. Checkmate.[SEP]B:Okay, I like the plan! I&amp;#39;ve asked France if they&amp;#39;re willing to move to Brest supported by me.[SEP]B:Aren&amp;#39;t you concerned about England taking Mao? I&amp;#39;d sooner just have you pile on support into Bre so that Wes can support Mao holding[SEP]A:That’s a good point, but the problem with that approach is that Brest is not guaranteed. If England cute MAO and supports with the Channel, the attack fails. I think we are better off ensuring that the Brest fleet is disbanded. If we disband that fleet and take North Sea, an English fleet in MAO really just spreads him out and allows you to take the island faster. It’s not like he can get Portugal or Spain.[SEP]B:Okay, but that means I&amp;#39;d prefer to take Brest myself this Spring, if France is okay with it.[SEP]A:I think that we should offer France Brest in Spring. That ensures that he is with us. Then, if conditions are right in the Fall, I can support you into Brest. But...England can offer France Belgium, and I think he is sure to take that if we’re not even offering him a center, right?[SEP]A:Better to keep France feeling like we’re going to keep him in the game. If you need the build in Fall, it’s easy for me to support you there.[SEP]B:I guess I’m just wondering from France’s perspective why they’d *want* to stay in the game. Isn’t it possible they’d rather move on with their life? That’s not rhetorical, I’m wondering what your perspective is as a veteran player[SEP]A:Here is my take: If France just wanted to go down in a blaze of glory and say “eff you” to England, he would have kept Irish Sea. He kept Pic, which is next to his home center, and gives him a chance to negotiate with both you and England.[SEP]A:I think that means he is motivated to keep trying. And if he believes he can get Brest, he could legitimately get back to his feet. I know that’s what I’d be trying to do in his position.[SEP]A:As the poker saying goes: “a chip and a chair.” So long as you have one chip left, and you’re still in the tournament, you can always come back to win.[SEP]A:Thoughts?[SEP]B:I think that makes sense. Are you talking with England at all?[SEP]A:I’m pretty wary of England right now. He asked me what I want to do, but I feel like he’s trying to get me to leave MAO open. That’s not terrible news, as it suggests that he won’t expect your move to North Sea.[SEP]A:As long as he doesn’t move NAO to Norwegian, you’ve got a guaranteed supply center.[SEP]B:Well E&amp;#39;d have to be a right dolt not to retreat to NWG. And right now they&amp;#39;re talking to me about supporting a move from Bre to Gas (the better for the two of us to stab you).[SEP]B:What i mean is, there&amp;#39;s a good chance that Mao is safe if I &amp;#34;agree&amp;#34; to that deal[SEP]B:Oh nevermind--they&amp;#39;re not going to convoy into Brest. So actually this pretty much guarantees that Eng and Nao will try for Mao.[SEP]A:Ahhhh, sneaky Devil! Thank you for letting me know.[SEP]A:I still like our plan.[SEP]A:I need to run for a bit. I’ll be around in a few hours.[SEP]B:I think that knowing this, you should do as I suggest and not poke Eng. Just hold and let Wes support. I am 94% sure I can trust England to do as they say on this one.[SEP]A:Okay. Should I support Pic to Bre?[SEP]B:yes please. It&amp;#39;ll do us good with France too if we both support.[SEP]A:👍[SEP]B:Actually, you should use Mao to support Spa-Gas, since we know that Brest is moving there. It will be beneficial to have you there if we decide to oust France from Bre in fall[SEP]A:Consider it done.[SEP]A:Hmmmm, heading anything from England?[SEP]A:I’d love to talk if you’re there. I’m getting the impression that England may actually be moving on you, and I think I have a good counter, but I also still think we should support the attack on Brest and take North Sea.[SEP]A:I definitely think you should keep your moves the same.[SEP]A:Nice! Get’em! He WAS moving on you. But we should be able to take about 3 off of him now. Very nice turn.[SEP]B:Sorry; I was asleep by 9 last night 😂 why the move to Nao? Wouldn&amp;#39;t IRI be the more anti-England choice? With the move to Picardy and assuming a retreat to SKA, it looks like England has me pretty powerless this turn.[SEP]B:So do you, it seems, if you have some kind of deal with Russia about Munich.[SEP]A:Good morning. Just responding to your messages above. I think NAO and Irish are equally anti-English. They both give me a clear lane to attack Liverpool. I wasn’t sure if either one would be left open, but I took a gamble and it paid off.[SEP]A:Re your move this turn, I don’t think you’re powerless. You should get a build I think and if not, you should be in position to smash England.[SEP]A:I don’t have a deal regarding Munich, Germany. Frankly, I thought you would be a bit more joyful towards me. By attacking England, I have committed completely to working as your partner.[SEP]B:I suppose you&amp;#39;re right. Initially I was thinking IRI also gives you channel access, but NWG access may be just as useful. Well when you control half a continent (and even more when you consider your influence over me, austria, and who knows who else!), there&amp;#39;s no such thing as complete commitment. I&amp;#39;m not so naive as to think your allegiance with me is going to last beyond its usefulness, and with two fleets on the British isle that time is fast approaching. To be clear, I&amp;#39;m still giving you the truth and I still want to work with you. But you should really stop acting surprised when I&amp;#39;m slightly paranoid that a soon-to-be-dozen-dot-holder is gearing up to stab me[SEP]A:Well, I dunno, it sounds like I should stab you. Is that what you’re trying to tell me? I like you. I like how hard you’ve worked in this game to rebound from a difficult start. I like that you e told me the truth, even when the news was bad. I like that you tell me when you don’t trust me. I have literally never told you a lie in this game, and I don’t intend to start now. Last turn I burned my bridge with England beyond repair. If you don’t want to work with me now, that’s really disappointing.[SEP]B:like I said, I *do* want to work with you. However, remember that thing I said about general expectations and being warned when they&amp;#39;re broken? Tyrolia is one of them and I think you knew that. And England *also* told me they&amp;#39;ve never told me a lie; I&amp;#39;m starting to think that&amp;#39;s Diplomacy-speak for &amp;#34;when convenient, I&amp;#39;ve used careful wording and half-truths to deceive you even when everything I said was technically true&amp;#34;. It would help me to know that you see me being a benefit to you beyond taking out England. A natural next move for us would be to take out russia, and in that arena I have a positional advantage over you. Especially if I get two builds this turn, I&amp;#39;ll be able to sneak behind the troops in bohemia/galicia and help you break through.[SEP]A:Yes — here is how I expect and hope the game will play out: the two of us finish off England and France, while drifting towards the east a bit. With the builds we get this year, we essentially blitzkrieg the East. I have more units than you, but you have no opposition at all in the north, and can take Scandinavia, War and Mos without any trouble.[SEP]A:I think that, in about two years, you and I will both be on about 14 centers, with the remnants of Russia and Austria between us, and we can decide how we want to resolve it. I’d be happy to agree to a small draw, or to shoot for a 17-17 two-way draw position, whichever you prefer.[SEP]B:Well, I like the sound of all of that. In fact, it sounds ideal: there&amp;#39;s something poetic about the complete beginner and the expert (you&amp;#39;ve probably heard by now that you got doxxed) sharing a victory. I ask for a concession: As a show of good will, would you be willing to take only one of Liverpool or Portugal this year? (I know the Portugal request seems weird, but I like keeping France around and unless I&amp;#39;m mistaken they like me better than you 😃 )[SEP]A:Yes. I wasn’t planning to take Portugal anyway.[SEP]A:I think it makes sense here for you to land an army in the English island while you can. Now that his army is off the island, he’s toast as soon as you do that.[SEP]B:England&amp;#39;s just vindictive enough to try and stab Belgium with England and Picardy, though. I was planning on keeping holland around as support.[SEP]B:*by England I of course mean Eng[SEP]A:I suggest the following: Gas - Liv (via convoy) Spa S MAO holding Mar hold Tyr - Tri Hol - Yor (via convoy) Bur S Bel Bel S North HEL S North Mun - Boh Par - Pic (to cut any potential support)[SEP]A:England cannot take Belgium with those moves.[SEP]A:Or I could move my fleet into Liverpool and use Gas to support Bre. I’m happy either way.[SEP]B:I tried a double convoy in the sandbox once and it didn&amp;#39;t work! What is this witchcraft?!?[SEP]B:At any rate, I prefer the fleet move to liverpool and Gascony&amp;#39;s support into Brest. And could Mao support Bre into the Channel? No sense forcing France to disband. Bel will support it, too.[SEP]A:Here are the orders needed to do a convoy! Holland move to Yorkshire North Sea convoy Holland to Yorkshire It is not a “double convoy” as you only need one fleet to make it happen. But if your fleet in North Sea is dislodged, the convoy will not go through. That is why I would suggest that HELG supports North Sea holding and Belgium supports North Sea holding.[SEP]B:No--I mean the one *you* were planning: Gascony to Liverpool[SEP]B:It&amp;#39;s a double convoy because you&amp;#39;re convoying through Mao *and* Nao[SEP]A:Ah, the orders there would be: Gascony - Liv MAO Convoy Gas - Liv NAO Convoy Gas - Liv[SEP]A:So, I’ll move the fleet to Liverpool. And you want MAO to support Paris to Brest?[SEP]A:Or wait, MAO supports Brest to Channel, and Gas supports Paris - Brest, right?[SEP]B:yeah. I tried that once in the sandbox (or the equivalent: back when you had fleets in Lyo and Wes I tried a convoy from Pie to Naf). But I think I messed up the commands to the fleets. And yes the most recent message is correct. Those two things and Nao-Lvp[SEP]A:Okay, confirmed. So I’ve got in: NAO - Liv MAO S Bre - Channel Gas S Par - Bre Spa - WES Mar S Gas holding Tyrolia - Trieste Sound right?[SEP]B:It does. But If Tyr was bound for trieste anyway, why did you detour through Tyr at all? Why not just move to trieste last turn??[SEP]A:Austria would not have liked it.[SEP]A:And he doesn’t know that it’s headed back there now (please don’t tell)[SEP]B:Understood. Me and Austria don&amp;#39;t talk anyway. Also, do you have any sense of what England is planning to do?[SEP]A:Ha! No I don’t. I’d imagine he is coming for me. But I don’t know that.[SEP]A:If I were him, I’d defend Edi and London.[SEP]B:So you haven&amp;#39;t been talking to England at all? I was sort of hoping you would know more, maybe help us take better advantage of their plans.[SEP]B:Anyway, my moves are: Par-Bre Bel s Bre-Eng Hol s Bel holding And the rest within expected parameters. Correct?[SEP]A:England has not said anything of substance to me. He was gracious about my move, but he won’t trust me again, and I would not trust anything he might say at this point. I haven’t asked him about his moves and he hasn’t told me.[SEP]A:I thought you would Convoy Holland to Yorkshire and support Belgium from Burgundy. Also, can you please order Mun to Boh to cut support and allow me to hold Vienna while moving Tyrolia to Trieste?[SEP]B:I *told* you I&amp;#39;m not risking that convoy *and* that instead Bel is supporting France into the Channel (which will heretofore be called the French Channel). And could I persuade you to move to IRI instead of taking Liverpool in exchange for the requested cut?[SEP]A:Sorry, what is the requested cut? I understand that you don’t want me to take Liverpool or Portugal. What are you offering to me? (I don’t mean to be difficult, I just want to be sure I understand).[SEP]A:Ah, you must mean Munich to Boh.[SEP]A:Asking me to avoid taking Por and Liv is asking a lot. I want France to survive here, but I also want England taking units off the board, and I feel like you should too, right?[SEP]B:I do. But I also want those dots for myself, of course. And there&amp;#39;s still the nonzero chance that you&amp;#39;ve arranged with Boh to take Munich for yourself, so I&amp;#39;m taking a serious risk[SEP]A:I will avoid taking Portugal, vacate Tyrolia, and support you to Brest. I feel like I’m offering quite a lot in exchange for one cut support. And cutting that support does not put you in greater peril. If I had a deal with Russia for Munich (I don’t) I could cut Burgundy from Marseilles and support Russia to Munich. Moving Mun to Boh to cut support is costless.[SEP]B:You&amp;#39;re right. I just thought I&amp;#39;d put my best argument forward. I&amp;#39;ll do the cut. But I ask for something costless in exchange, and I really, really want it to stay just between us, ok?[SEP]A:Understood and agreed.[SEP]A:And I have no problem with you asking for more than you’re willing to settle for. That’s smart, and I do the same thing sometimes. If you don’t stick up for yourself, nobody else will.[SEP]B:I *know* there&amp;#39;s more to your relationship with England than you&amp;#39;re telling me. The last message England sent to me hinted that if *I* wasn&amp;#39;t willing to work with them--and I haven&amp;#39;t said anything to them since--that maybe *you* would. And if England were to reach out to you, you&amp;#39;re too smart to just snub them. There&amp;#39;s advantage to be gained--either for both of us or just for yourself--from talking to them. The only reason I stopped was because I knew my word would be mud to them anyway. Earlier I was hoping you&amp;#39;d give me the truth about what you knew, and about what they might know. But you didn&amp;#39;t and that both disappoints and scares me. So I&amp;#39;m asking that you give me just a modicum of honesty here: what do you know? what does England know?[SEP]A:I give you my word: I don’t know what England is going to do and I haven’t asked.[SEP]A:He is still jovial with me and respectful. He has asked me to critique his play and to give him advice. But I do not know his moves, and I really don’t think he would tell me them if I asked. It certainly would not be info I could trust free I just lied to him about mine.[SEP]B:But England&amp;#39;s desperate. Better to talk with *someone* than just go in blind. And I doubt they&amp;#39;d turn to Russia or France because neither is really close enough/powerful enough to give real help. And there&amp;#39;s precedent for you negotiating with someone even as you stab them: France. ...and here&amp;#39;s the real accusation: for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me, you&amp;#39;ve been sneaky and you&amp;#39;ve always pitted me and England against each other to your benefit. My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking your advice, it would be so *easy* to just feed England enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island. I know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over. And I assume others are like me, hence I suspect you now. I&amp;#39;m offering this confession in hopes that you&amp;#39;ll do the same. So just come clean and let&amp;#39;s approach this thing as equals?[SEP]A:I am in my car, off to pick-up my kids from school. This deserves a proper response, so please give me some time.[SEP]B:Abandon the children this is important 😜[SEP]A:So, I’m going to speak frankly here. I am rarely offended in a Diplomacy game, and I rarely say so when I am, but this message offends me. I’m trying to think about why I’m having such a strong reaction to it. I think it’s because you’re painting a picture of the game (both your actions and mine) which are totally different than my own perspective. (Continuing)[SEP]A:From my perspective, you were on the ropes early. France and England were teaming up on you. You lost Denmark and France had Holland and Munich surrounded. You were in serious peril. I seriously went to extreme effort to keep you in the game. I spent hours talking with England and encouraging him to turn around and go the other way. I completely ended my eastern campaign and spent two seasons just making the voyage over to France so that he didn’t have the bandwidth to continue his attack. I have vouched for you with Austria and Russia many times. I have supported Munich. And I have NEVER attacked you, even when people have asked me to do so and pledged to support me.[SEP]A:I have been honest with you, I have worked hard for your success, and I’ve made a lot of proposals to you in which you gain centers; not me. Maybe I am just a bad ally, but I’m not sure I remember an alliance in which I have done more to help my ally. Truly.[SEP]A:And to hear that (1) You think I’ve been selfish and (2) You’ve been sabotaging me all along, that just doesn’t sit well with me.[SEP]A:I have rarely asked for your help, and I’ve offered my help freely. I’ve provided my sincere best efforts to help you with tactics, and I have never sabotaged you. Not once.[SEP]A:And if I’m totally honest with you, I could solo this game if I felt like lying to everyone and grabbing dots. I think I’ve got you all beat tactically. I just have more experience. But that’s not been my intent.[SEP]A:I’ve spent hours today talking with England about how best to play Diplomacy. I’ve tried to give him some honest advice because he asked for it. But I don’t know his moves, I haven’t asked for them, and I’m not going to take advantage of that relationship to try to stab you. It legitimately did not cross my mind until you accused me of doing it.[SEP]A:So, I’m frustrated by this accusation.[SEP]B:And I appreciate all you’ve done for me, really I do. But “completely ending your eastern campaign” is *not* something you did for me; your alliance with Austria dictated that. I felt bad for betraying you while I was doing it, but even then I knew it was the only way to keep the game going in the face of your and Austria’s might. And it *wasn’t* “all along”, it was a few turns at best so that the rest of us would have a shot at you and Austria not pair-winning right out of the gate. And the only thing that keeps me from thinking you’re not gonna do just that on the next move anyway is my belief that you really do want the victory all to yourself, which is still consistent with everything you’ve done for me. Propping up a weak player at the expense of stronger ones is a classic tactic. (Continuing)[SEP]B:And so, by the way, is trying to shame someone for raising extremely legitimate concerns. Whenever I bring up suspicion of you, you’re quick to remind me how much you’ve done for me to put me on the defensive and make me feel indebted. Well frankly that reeks of dishonesty. I never asked you to do those things.[SEP]B:If you no longer trust me, so be it. I knew that was a risk when I made my confession. But i’d rather have a partnership based on mutual honesty. That’s another reason I confessed—you ought to know that my game philosophy (new as it is) is to trust the map and to trust history first and foremost. The parts of your history that I’ve seen indicate that you’re no saint, no matter what you may have done for me. And when the map shows that one player is clearly dominating and that player is you, you are being deeply naive if you think everyone else is just going to roll over and let you get away with it[SEP]A:No, all thumbs up from me. If I were lying to you, I’d smile and say “that sounds great.” I’m honest with you because I sincerely thought of us as partners.[SEP]B:Oh but you’re *not*! You agreed to warn me of unexpected moves, then didn’t. When I brought this up you ignored it and misdirected me in hopes I’d forget. You’ve revealed things to England without my permission, and then made up a story about it after the fact! And you can’t be a real partner with someone who is depending on your good graces to survive. That’s not a partnership. We could never be real partners unless we had some notion of equality, and I’m outmatched in both skill and numbers. You and Austria, however, were until recently a perfect example of a true partnership. Dot-parity, coordinated attacks, really beautiful work. So don’t act as if you don’t know this to be true. We were never a partnership of that kind.[SEP]A:Well, this is very disappointing to me, and I obviously disagree with the way you are characterizing me and this game. I have a reputation in this hobby for being sincere. Not for being duplicitous. It has always served me well. If you feel that way, then me continuing to explain myself isn’t going to change your mind. If you don’t want to work with me, then I can understand that. Let’s consider our deals and commitments to be void, and let’s play our games separately. If you have any deal you’d like to propose, I’ll consider them, but I won’t continue to try to help your game if you think I’m not sincerely trying to be helpful.[SEP]A:Well, this game just got less fun.[SEP]B:for you, maybe.[SEP]A:Sent to Germany, England, Austria, Russia: So, England, Germany, Russia, y’all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would “teach him” and help his along to second place. Then y’all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)[SEP]A:(Part 2) At this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I’m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for “Hey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,” but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that’s really my preference. I am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo. And I’m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I’m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany’s favor. I propose that we draw and hug it out.🤗[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;m down for a five-way draw. ...and by the way, England was copy-pasting to me the most incriminating messages you sent them. So I knew you were giving England my moves. I do have a certain begrudging respect for you ability to deny, though 😉[SEP]A:Well, England is telling me he is happy to see me solo and wants second place...so, should I say “no”? I guess I should have. I was happy the way the game was going before all that.[SEP]B:Don&amp;#39;t try and pin *your* greed and deceit on England! At least *own* it when you&amp;#39;re ruthless[SEP]A:You have been given an apple laced with poison. England’s only move there was to make you hate me, and he did his job well. You should not let your view of me be defined by someone who has an incentive to make you never speak to me again. We can talk about it more after the game, but I had every intention of continuing to work with you, and I would have done that until England made his play.[SEP]B:I have no doubt you would have continued to work with me, but I take issue with someone who can be asked point-blank if they&amp;#39;re sharing moves with another player and lie to my face. If you&amp;#39;d come clean, and explained how what you were doing actually *helped* me, somehow, we could have worked together. But you would rather have had me in the dark and that&amp;#39;s not sustainable in a partnership.[SEP]A:I was trying to play both sides, and England was lying to me, and forwarding my press to try to incriminate me. So, yes, I lied, and so did England. I apologize.[SEP]A:Will you please either vote to draw, or let us know that you’d like to play this one out? I am finding it difficult to motivate myself to speak with anyone if the game is just going to draw shortly. Thoughts?[SEP]B:I did vote to 5-way draw! And I did so again for this season. So it’s not me who’s keeping this game alive[SEP]A:Well, as we approach the end of the academic study portion of the game, let me say once, with the truth detector activated, that I really enjoyed playing with you and thought you played really well.[SEP]A:Was it really your first game? You definitely played like a seasoned vet.[SEP]B:I really enjoyed playing with you, too! And yes, it really was my first game. Thanks for all your help and advice[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2nd row&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;white-space:pre white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;[CLS]B:Hello there! What&amp;#39;s your general plan for this game? My inclination when I play Austria is to piss off as few people as possible, so I don&amp;#39;t plan on making any overtly aggressive moves this turn.[SEP]A:Hi Austria. Nice to meet you, and looking forward to playing as your neighbor. Hmmmm, I hate playing as Italy. I rarely succeed. Frankly, I’ve recently tried early attacks on Austria, as Italy, AND IT KEEPS TURNING OUT POORLY. I’d really like to play this one as a tight-knit Central Trio if you have any appetite for that. Not sure if I should set up a Lepanto or go west, but I’d be happy to hear your thoughts on it.[SEP]B:That sounds good to me. I think probably what would work best is if you and Germany go west while Turkey and I contain and/or eat Russia, then once I&amp;#39;ve picked up some Russian dots and gotten some good position, you split your fleets to help me take Turkey and help Germany take England.[SEP]A:I like that. Let me talk it over with Germany.[SEP]A:I’m not sure whether Germany is keen on attacking France. Perhaps you and I should focus on Turkey?[SEP]B:Yeah, honestly, the more I think about it, the more I think it&amp;#39;ll just be easier to wipe turkey off the map really quickly. I&amp;#39;ve done it in tourneys a few times before and it just makes everything simpler.[SEP]A:👌 So I’ll open as a standard Lepanto. Sounds good.[SEP]A:Nice start! Really glad to see Turkey open north, and glad to see that you were true to your word with me. I feel like we’re in a really strong position to control the East! What are you thinking?[SEP]B:Yep! Good start, now we&amp;#39;ve just gotta follow through properly.[SEP]A:So, do I just convoy my army to Tunis? Also, do you want me to bounce you in Trieste?[SEP]B:Sure, Trieste bounce is a good idea. And yeah, standard Lepanto with the convoy.[SEP]A:So...how shall we go about this? I’m kind of thinking that you and I should eat some Turkey.[SEP]B:That&amp;#39;s exactly what I&amp;#39;m thinking. I&amp;#39;m going to send Greece into the Aegean, you send Ionian into Eastern Med.[SEP]A:Okay. Cool! Do you mind if I take Greece this year while you take Bulgaria? That will keep us even, and should be guaranteed. I can just convoy an army to Greece in Spring while you move to Aegean, and I can support you to Bulgaria in the Fall. This also means you don’t have to rotate your armies all the way to Greece, which will allow you to mobilize against Russia faster when the time comes. Thoughts?[SEP]A:Any thoughts on this idea?[SEP]A:I am going to send my fleet over to Eastern Med and we can work this out next turn.[SEP]B:Sorry about that, today got a little nuts. Figuring it out next turn is probably the best call, once we see what&amp;#39;s worked and what hasn&amp;#39;t.[SEP]A:Okay, thank you for being true to your word. I think we’re in great shape. My major concern on the board right now is E/F, which is likely going to take down Germany quickly and become a major force. It is really important to me to get a build here so that I can try to keep France in check a bit. Will you agree that You get Bulgaria, I get Greece, and we can move forward with both of us at 5? I really think that the two of us can dominate this game if we keep working together.[SEP]B:Yep, I&amp;#39;m just fine with that.[SEP]A:Great! I will convoy Tunis to Greece. If you can support that move, that would be great. And it looks like you’ll have no problem supporting Greece to Bulgaria.[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;ll have a more direct response once the retreats are all resolved and I&amp;#39;m not extrapolating what the board state will probably be, but that seems eminently doable.[SEP]A:How’s it looking over there?[SEP]B:Looking solid! I don&amp;#39;t think we actually need to coordinate all that much, we&amp;#39;re in a really good position.[SEP]A:Just to be clear, should I expect Greece will be open?[SEP]B:Yep, it will be. I&amp;#39;ll want it back eventually, but for now it&amp;#39;s yours.[SEP]A:You, sir, are a terrific ally. This was more than you needed to do, but makes me feel like this is really a long term thing! Thank you.[SEP]B:We can do great things together, long term. I figured a down-payment now against that great future would be worth it.[SEP]B:Plus, you ever try digging out a talented Italy as Austria? It&amp;#39;s a pain in the fuckin neck! :P[SEP]A:🤗[SEP]A:Yeah, let’s just work together. Should be a good one for both of us.[SEP]A:What should I build? I’m pretty undecided and would be willing to let you choose.[SEP]B:I think probably a fleet will serve you best, in terms of flexibility. We&amp;#39;ve got Turkey, he&amp;#39;s doomed by numbers, so you want to start thinking France.[SEP]A:👌[SEP]A:Okay, how would you like to approach this turn? I’m at your disposal.[SEP]B:I think what we do is, AEG convoys GRE-SMY with support from EAS while BUL taps CON[SEP]B:That&amp;#39;s just an initial thought, though - if you have a better idea I&amp;#39;m all ears[SEP]A:My concern there is that Arm doesn’t have much to do other than support Smyrna, and I don’t know if we want to rely on Russia helping. I think he has a serious incentive to prevent us from succeeding too quickly against Turkey.[SEP]B:Very good point. Perhaps you tap SMY with EAS and I use AEG to support BUL-CON, with the intention of then doing the convoy in the fall?[SEP]A:What do you think of Aegean support Bul to Con while I cut support in Smy? That is guaranteed so long as Russia does not support Con back to Bul (unlikely), and we don’t have to tell Russia the complete plan.[SEP]A:Yes, we xposted, but we are thinking the same way.[SEP]B:Well it appears our messages passed each other in the internet&amp;#39;s series of tubes, but, great minds, etc etc[SEP]A:Good. Consider it done.[SEP]A:I’m thinking about sending an army over to Piedmont to keep France honest. Do you think that is a good idea or a terrible idea? I just want to avoid a stampede over Germany, and I feel like forcing him to use an army in Marseilles to bounce with me is worth dedicating one army from me. But I don’t want to antagonize I’ve him either. I keep going back and forth about it. What do you think?[SEP]B:I think probably we give France one season to see what they do. England build F LON and France built F BRE, which is something we should keep an eye on before moving.[SEP]A:Okay. If he does say anything to you about moving towards me, would you please let me know? I feel like he’s in an awfully strong position, and it makes me nervous.[SEP]B:You&amp;#39;ll be the first to know. Man, isn&amp;#39;t this game simpler when you&amp;#39;re being honest?[SEP]A:👍[SEP]B:France says they&amp;#39;re getting radio silence from England, which is probably good news for us.[SEP]B:Russia says you&amp;#39;re trying to get him to attack me, heh[SEP]A:That sounds like the kind of thing Russia would say. I have generally told Russia that I am not close with you and I’d be willing to attack you, but I’ve never “tried to get him to attack you. That is a complete 👎. Our alliance seems to be the one trusting alliance in the game. Everyone is going to try to break us up. We need to prevent it.[SEP]B:That&amp;#39;s about what I figured. Wanted to let you know it was being tried.[SEP]B:Also, England is extremely unhappy with France.[SEP]A:Yeah, sounds like England is attacking France. That’s good for us. We seem to be the only alliance that has its act together.[SEP]B:Which can mean only profit for us, as long as we stick together.[SEP]A:Word. Listen, I’m an alliance player. That’s how I’ve always been. I think it’s the only way to play. I don’t like to shift around. I like a close working relationship with a partner. That’s what we have, and that’s what I plan to stick with as long as you’ll have me.[SEP]B:&amp;#39;til death or end of beta do us part, then 😛[SEP]A:That said, I don’t want anyone else to know that. So if people ask, I’ll tell them that I’d be happy to attack you.[SEP]B:Oh naturally, I&amp;#39;ll bullshit the hell outta everyone else.[SEP]B:Sooooooooo. Tyrolia?[SEP]B:Test[SEP]A:You don’t like it? I figured it was the same as Venice. If I wanted to attack you, I could have just moved to Trieste any time. My purpose in Tyrolia is to keep Munich black. I’m just going to support Munich holding. I don’t want Germany to get trampled.[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;d have preferred a heads-up, is all.[SEP]B:So, we going with the same plan? I convoy Greece over to Smyrna?[SEP]A:Sorry — I’ve been slammed all day. Just looking at this again now.[SEP]A:Okay, I’m so sorry. I got distracted again. Yes! I will order GRE to SMY, EAS S GRE to SMY, TYR S MUN holding. Will you allow me a build this turn or do you plan on retaking Greece now?[SEP]B:Sounds good to me.[SEP]A:Any word on Greece? Basically, if I get a build this turn I can turn around and smash France. If I don’t, that will be a more tepid attack.[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;ve got no need to immediately take it, since I&amp;#39;m picking up Con.[SEP]A:Okay. Thank you. 😊[SEP]A:Hey, by the way, I am going to be candid here: I have thought about attacking you. I really have. But I have recently arrived at the conclusion that this would be a poor path forward. I’m not going to do it. I’ll move on France now. That will give you the peace of mind to know that my units will be occupied and far from you.[SEP]B:Glad to hear, yep![SEP]A:Let’s just keep right on working together, and press our advantage b[SEP]A:I suggest you move Alb to Ser and prepare to attack Russia in Spring.[SEP]A:You can have Ank, but I really do think it makes sense that I keep Greece. Ending up with 2 centers from Turkey/Balkans seems fair, with you getting everything else, yes?[SEP]B:Yeah, I think I can live with that.[SEP]B:Sorry it took me a moment to respond, it&amp;#39;s the MLB home run derby tonight[SEP]A:Well that, I can understand.[SEP]A:Look, like I said, I was wavering a bit, especially during the long weekend. But, I’ve taken a close look, and I just think that this alliance has unique staying power. I really do. We both have room to grow. Now that England attacked France, there isn’t really anyone who can stop us. This can work long term, and work well.[SEP]B:I wholeheartedly agree. Neither of us benefits from attacking the other.[SEP]A:So, This one seems easy. I’ll support you to Ankara, and you are guaranteed either Ankara or Rumania: Con - Ank Smy S Con - Ank Age - Con EAS S Smy holding Ven - Pie Tyr S Mun holding TYS - LYO Tun - WES Ser - Rum Bul S Ser - Rum Bud S Ser - Rum Vie - Gal Sound right?[SEP]B:I had already entered every single one of those orders, except for AEG-CON, which is in now. It&amp;#39;s nice being on the same page, isn&amp;#39;t it?[SEP]A:👍[SEP]A:I kind of figured. It’s a pretty straight-forward move for both of us, and likely gains for both of us. This alliance is in a really healthy place.[SEP]B:So, I assume you&amp;#39;re going to support Ank to hold?[SEP]B:Also, fyi, I&amp;#39;m in transit to SkyCon out in Montana, so I might not be the most communicative gent this weekend.[SEP]A:Hi Austria. I apologize for the delay. Quite a busy day for me yesterday. I have no problem supporting Ank to hold.[SEP]A:I also want to say — looks like that support ensures you get two builds. My own attack on France is not quite so successful. Do you mind if I borrow Trieste this turn to stay even with you and keep my momentum going west. I’ll place another fleet with it, which further locks me in moving away from you. I think that’s actually quite good for you, but I know some players get prickly about home centers.[SEP]B:A dot is a dot is a dot. It&amp;#39;s better for the long term health of the alliance, and I&amp;#39;m still building one. More importantly, your best/easiest route to growth still lies in France, not with me, so I don&amp;#39;t see you having a ton of incentive to go after me. Go for it.[SEP]A:OMG. 😮 You are my favorite ally of all time. This just happened. You just past the threshold. It used to be this guy who was playing France to my England. Funny dude. Great stories. But he never sacrificed a home center in the interest of parity. You are a rare gem.[SEP]A:Do you think 17-17 is an okay result for a beta test?[SEP]A:I feel like I can’t stab you now. So I’d like to simply crush the board with you.[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;ve never said no to 17/17, lol[SEP]B:What&amp;#39;s your planned build?[SEP]A:F Nap. Sound good?[SEP]B:Yeah, Naples makes it look like we might actually be fighting, go for it.[SEP]A:Well, I hope you had a nice weekend. Do you think we have much to discuss here? Is there anything you’d like me to do with my three eastern units? Do you want me to pretend to fight you, or shall I just move away or hold still? I don’t really have any idea what I should be doing.[SEP]B:My weekend was great! I placed 8th at SkyCon, which was a disproportionately talented tourney, so I&amp;#39;m feeling quite good about myself. I&amp;#39;d like your army in Smyrna to support my move from Ankara to Armenia, but other than that, I see no point in pretending to fight each other, so I figure you might as well move stuff west to take care of your new main front.[SEP]A:Okay, that works for me.[SEP]A:Do you want me to move Eastern Med to Aegean? If your move to Armenia works (likely), you may want to use my fleet to bounce with you at Con to keep The Russian fleet out. But totally up to you. I don’t care either way.[SEP]B:Right now I&amp;#39;ve just got my fleet in Con tapping Black, so it&amp;#39;ll probably stay full. Get the fleet where it can help with France.[SEP]A:Thoughts on where we go from here?[SEP]A:My units are at your disposal.[SEP]A:I think the best way to take Rum would look like this: Bul - Rum Ser and Bud S Bul - Rum Con - Bul (EC) Arm and Smy bounce in Ank Tyr and Gal bounce in Vienna (Anticipating that Black Sea will likely move to Bul to cut support)[SEP]A:Everything still okay?[SEP]B:I like it, yeah, let&amp;#39;s do that.[SEP]B:Folks are trying to pry us apart, but their arguments aren&amp;#39;t making a ton of sense.[SEP]A:Yeah, I’m getting the same treatment. If we stay together, we win together.[SEP]A:Argh! I KNEW Black Sea would try for Bulgaria!!! Shoot![SEP]A:My wife says I am bossy and uniquely inflexible. I don’t want you to feel that way too! How shall we approach this next turn? I think we need to put in a good set of orders here to turn the tide against Russia.[SEP]B:Here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve got right now: A Arm - Sev F BLA - Con A Bud S Gal - Rum A Gal - Rum A Rum - Bul A Ser S Rum - Bul[SEP]B:I figure if you bounce me in Con, that piffs the Russian fleet.[SEP]A:Yeah, not bad. The danger is in Rumania. Are you thinking Gal - Ukr, Bud - Rum? Shall I order Tyr - Vie? I think that is likely best as it keeps Russia out of your centers for sure, and it should easy to support me out in the Fall once Russia has one less unit.[SEP]B:Yep, that seems like the best course of action.[SEP]A:So look, I’m at your disposal in the east. I think the best bet may be for you to support me from Vienna to Galicia, but I’m willing to do something else if you like something else better.[SEP]A:Frankly, if I were you, I’d be worried about a stab from Italy here. 🤭 But I’m not going to do that. You e been extremely good to me. And it would be a very bad time for me to begin a war in the east while all my units are west. So you’re stuck with me as an ally.[SEP]B:Yep, that all checks out, and I was thinking Vie-Gal was the best call, so let&amp;#39;s make that happen.[SEP]A:Well that is damn annoying. I’m surprised he tried for Vienna — would have thought he would go for Rumania.[SEP]A:I do think that we can guarantee you Sev this year, which should finally crack this nut.[SEP]B:Yeah. I&amp;#39;d also like to address the center imbalance a bit more directly - as you pick up dots in the west, I&amp;#39;d like to start picking Greece, Vienna, and Ankara back up.[SEP]B:Er, Smyrna, not Ankara.[SEP]A:Totally agree.[SEP]A:Yes, we need to take that in swiftly. Let’s see what the builds look like and make a plan.[SEP]A:Hi Austria — So, this is a big turn for us. I am absolutely committed to getting you a build. I wish we could get you more than one, but unfortunately the fact that you lost Vienna last turn makes that impossible. So, it seems to me that the most important way to get you a build is to take Galicia in Spring. I don’t care if I move there, or you move there, but we need to make some room around Budapest so that you can build there.[SEP]B:Yeah, I&amp;#39;d appreciate your support from Bud-Gal.[SEP]A:Maybe something like this: Bud - Gal Vie S Bud - Gal Rum - Sev BLS S Rum - Sev Arm S Rum - Sev Bul - Rum Ser - Bud If the move to Gal does not work, and you don’t get Sev, then in Fall you can order Bud - Tri while Vie and Ser bounce in Bud to ensure you get a build.[SEP]B:Oh yeah that looks better than what I had in mind. Let&amp;#39;s roll with that.[SEP]A:👍[SEP]A:One tweak: I am worried that Russia could take Rumania with the move set I proposed. You can prevent that by having Serbia support Bul - Rum. I think that’s better than Ser - Bud, and it makes sense because you want Bud open after the Fall anyway. That should mean that you won’t lose any ground this turn, and you’ll likely take Sev.[SEP]B:Oh yeah, good tweak, makes sense. So ordered.[SEP]A:Hey — man, Russia keeps guessing correctly. I am sincerely sorry that that move did not work. Thoughts on what to do this turn? I wish England or Germany would pick off a Russia. Center in the north, but they seem content to let Russia put up his road block.[SEP]B:Use Tyrolia to tap Bohemia, Vienna supports Budapest to Galicia, and Rumania taps Ukraine. Unless Bohemia goes to Vienna, that guarantees a move to Galicia.[SEP]B:Also, for my comfort, do you mind if I pick Trieste back up?[SEP]A:I like that. I was thinking that you would move Bud back to Tri, but this is much better. It keeps forward momentum. And yes, you should take back Tri now. That will make builds easier as we move forward.[SEP]B:Also, actually, I don&amp;#39;t have anything for Bulgaria to do, and you&amp;#39;re guaranteed two dots this turn. Can I take Greece back too? I can bank a build for the future regardless of what happens, and you stay even. You don&amp;#39;t really need a build right now.[SEP]A:Hmmm. I’m cool with you taking Trieste. I’m not sure that taking Greece now is the right move. In the West, I will take Liverpool, but not Portugal. I need to use my Spanish fleet to support MAO so that I can convoy an army to Liverpool. And I’m just in no hurry to take out France. So if you take Greece, you would be taking an Italian unit off the board and not building one yourself.[SEP]A:Also, seems like there is plenty of risk that Russia could try for Rumania. Why not use Bulg to support Rum, while having Rum and BLS Support Arm to Sev?[SEP]A:All that said, if you feel like you need to take two from me this turn in order to keep working with me, I can live with that.[SEP]A:The alliance is much more important to me than the dot.[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;ll take another look at it and get back to you.[SEP]A:Oh man. I’m getting a lot of hate mail out west. Not fun. I think Germany has a pretty low opinion of me, and it sounds like she and Russia are developing a bit of a romance. I am totally cool with you taking back Trieste this turn, and I am thankful that you loaned it to me in the first place. But I’d prefer if you wait to take Greece until you can actually use the build. It would make things quite a bit tougher for me if I have to take a unit off the board especially if we don’t get an extra unit in the east to compensate.[SEP]B:Yeah, if you&amp;#39;re not picking up Portugal, then I&amp;#39;ll let Greece be.[SEP]A:Argh. I blew it! I’m sorry. You were a terrific ally. I misread the board and thought that I had a clear solo run. England basically told me that he was going to help me solo, so I felt like I ought to just go for it. He bamboozled me, and for me to stab you. It was a mistake. My sincerest apologies.[SEP]B:I mean, I&amp;#39;m gonna have to fight you for at least a little bit. We&amp;#39;ll see what happens.[SEP]A:Yeah, I get that. It makes me sick because it’s likely that you’ll just get squeezed between me and Russia. Fighting me is not really a path toward viability for you, and that’s my fault. I’m sorry this happened. I really am. I misjudged the situation and I fear I’ve ruined both our games. If you can stick around and insist on getting some of the fruits of smashing me and not letting Russia get them all, that would be justice.[SEP]B:Oh, I&amp;#39;m definitely sticking around, and if you want to make it easier for me to pick up some dots, that&amp;#39;d go a long way to making me more viable and more inclined to resume the alliance.[SEP]A:Good.[SEP]A:I’m game for a draw if you guys want to wrap it up here.[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;d take a draw.[SEP]A:Sounds like Germany is the holdout.[SEP]A:I’m so mad at myself for taking the bait last turn. I had both Russia and England urging me to go for a solo, and it was just stupid of me to believe them. I’m going to try to leave both Tri and Bud open to you this turn. All yours.[SEP]A:Sent to Germany, England, Austria, Russia: So, England, Germany, Russia, y’all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would “teach him” and help his along to second place. Then y’all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)[SEP]A:(Part 2) At this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I’m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for “Hey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,” but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that’s really my preference. I am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo. And I’m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I’m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany’s favor. I propose that we draw and hug it out.🤗[SEP]B:I believe everyone is in for the draw. I&amp;#39;ve got it set, and I&amp;#39;m set for early adjudication.[SEP]A:Do you think this game is going to draw?[SEP]B:So, did you veto the draw?[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;3rd row&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;white-space:pre white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;[CLS]B:Buongiorno! Be kinda nice to know if you&amp;#39;re looking to move in a direction I might be interested in participating in. I fully understand if it&amp;#39;s too early to know, just know that channels and minds are both open .[SEP]A:Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen. I’m not writing to anyone else until I get things squared away with you. I LOVE the Wintergreen alliance. It works in the short-term (we only need to get A/T to fight) and it works in the long-term (resolves East before West, and we can’t really stab each other). Can we do this? I don’t care if we target T first or A first. I’ll let you decide. But I want to work as your partner. I am just hoping that you’re brilliant and fun too! I literally will not message anyone else until you and I have a plan. I want it to be clear to you that you’re the ally I want.[SEP]B:Well, Italy and France are, in my opinion, some of the best possible partners for Russia, so how could I possibly turn down such enthusiastic overtures from one of them?[SEP]A:Lovely. Would you rather we target Turkey first or Austria? I’m okay either way.[SEP]B:To be perfectly honest, that&amp;#39;s hard to say right now, since the decision doesn&amp;#39;t really affect my opening moves any (the standard southern opening spring moves are equally useful against either one), and I&amp;#39;d likely need to adjust based on what else happens on the Spring turn. Easiest just to say I&amp;#39;m opening South, flexibly considering the follow-through against either one of them.[SEP]A:Okay. Fair enough. One reason it might matter is because I could open with an aggressive attack on Austria if you want to blitz him quickly (e.g., DMZ Gal and then break it). Or you could organize a bounce in Gal and then not move there. On the other hand, if you’d prefer to take out Turkey first, I could go the standard Lepanto route. I’m happy to go either way, but I’d really like to coordinate with you if you’re game. Maybe we both need a fuller picture of what is happening first. I’ll begin to reach out to others now.[SEP]B:Sounds great - and here&amp;#39;s where it&amp;#39;s useful to know Austria has already indicated a bounce in Galicia, so opportunity to blitz him through there is severely limited.[SEP]A:Okay, that’s good to know. Thank you. I sent Austria a general first message offering friendship. I’ll let you know how things play out.[SEP]A:Hearing anything interesting? Both Austria and Turkey are acting cagey and conservative with me so far.[SEP]A:Hey, so, Austria seems to want to Lepanto now. You’re still the ally I want. And I’d like either to cut down Austria quickly or cut down Turkey quickly. If we decide to take out Austria first, I’d like you to let Austria in to Gal (just tell him this was a mistake). This will make it very hard for him to defend against me. If we decide to take out Turkey first, bounce Austria, and I’ll open as a traditional Lepanto. Thoughts?[SEP]B:Let&amp;#39;s do Turkey first. I&amp;#39;ll bounce Galicia[SEP]A:👌[SEP]A:Hi Russia, how’s it going? I hope this turn finds you well. I think my move is going to be fairly boring, but I’m still game for some adventure if you have any ideas. Also, would you mind asking Austria for a bounce again in Galicia? I’d just like to have a decent sense of what his units are doing. Any other thoughts?[SEP]B:Can do.[SEP]B:He doesn&amp;#39;t seem that interested in a Galicia bounce, fwiw[SEP]A:Okay, thank you for letting me know. That helps![SEP]A:I believe that Turkey is in for a world of hurt soon. I think you just need to expel that yellow army from Sev, and you should be in for a swift turnaround. Let’s kill Turkey, and then we kill Austria. Long live Wintergreen.[SEP]B:That&amp;#39;s the plan, mate[SEP]B:That went reasonably well. Looks like Austria is going to pick up Greece, so get wherever you can get and I&amp;#39;ll get you into doors where I can[SEP]B:Obviously Bulgaria, not Greece[SEP]A:Awesome. Thank you Russia. Any chance you can tap Black Sea this turn? I’m planning to take Greece, but I need Austria’s move to Bulgaria to succeed.[SEP]B:His move is guaranteed[SEP]A:What am I missing? It looks like it’s only guaranteed if you tap BLS. Otherwise, 3 - 3.[SEP]B:It&amp;#39;s 4-3. Rum, Ser, Gre, Aeg[SEP]A:Ah, cool. I did not realize that Rum was supporting Gre to Bul. That works too! Thank you.[SEP]A:Hi friend: can you please NOT support England into Denmark? I think that the last thing we want to see here is E/F trample over Germany. I feel like this is really important. Thoughts?[SEP]B:Ah, I did not see this in time. And one of the upshots was learning that England talks too damn much, so I probably won&amp;#39;t be helping him much going forward 😃[SEP]A:I feel like, perhaps it’s time to go all out against both T and A here? Something like this: Ven - Tri War - Gal Rum - BLS Sev S Ukr - Rum I may lose Greece this year, but I feel like it’s worth it to gain some momentum. Thoughts?[SEP]A:Hi Russia, My moves very much depend on you here so I’m looking forward to hearing from you. I think this is the right time for us both to hit Austria, but I’m not going to do it if you’re not on board. Thoughts?[SEP]B:Hey, sorry -focused on guests for the holiday. I&amp;#39;m currently ordered to move units around so I can move on Austria, without moving on him this turn. Basically getting the fleet out of the way.[SEP]A:Okay. Let’s shoot for next turn. Thank you![SEP]A:Russia, argh.... I sincerely want to work with you man. Truly. But if you sell me out and try to use what I tell you against me, it makes it really hard. Austria went right back to me and told me that you sold me out.[SEP]A:I want to move beyond this. But I need to know that what I tell you stays between us, or else I just can’t trust you and I can’t speak with you. I’d like to hear your side of this story. And I’d like to know that you’re not just going to tell Austria again. Let’s use this bump in the road as a lesson to work better together.[SEP]B:Eh? Are you really claiming I&amp;#39;ve been telling him anything useful, given that I said nothing about Greece? I mean, that looked kinda arranged to me, but nonetheless I gave him no heads up about your plan to move in, which should make it pretty clear I have no intention of passing on potentially useful info to him. 😀[SEP]A:So, where do we stand now?[SEP]B:You&amp;#39;re in the driver&amp;#39;s seat for path forward. I&amp;#39;m going to take Ankara, I assume you&amp;#39;ve negotiated the taking of Smyrna. Austria either needs to be given a path forward or dealt with, and England most likely needs dealt with. So... You have lots of options on path forward, and I&amp;#39;m mostly inclined to Ride along as most of my attention is likely to be in the North.[SEP]A:Well, here is my honest assessment: if you want to work with me, you have to commit to attack Austria with me. If you’re not interested in that, I’m not going to attack Austria, and it will basically be his choice whether he wants to attack me next or attack you next.[SEP]A:Frankly, I am still a little wary after the last time we discussed this, you ratted me out to Austria. But I can get over that if you actually want to be my partner.[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;m still not really sure how you think I &amp;#34;rated you out&amp;#34; to Austria given that I&amp;#39;ve really told him nothing useful at all. Greece was the test of that -even though I&amp;#39;m retrospect it&amp;#39;s obvious it was an arrangement, it&amp;#39;s also obvious I didn&amp;#39;t say anything to him when I thought you were stabbing him[SEP]B:But whatever, water under the bridge. I&amp;#39;m willing to move on Austria as soon as you give the word. I thought that&amp;#39;s what I pretty much just said -I&amp;#39;ll follow your lead in the South. You want to roll? Let&amp;#39;s roll.[SEP]B:Orders are in, moves on Austria, up to you to join in.[SEP]A:What moves on Austria would you like to see, and what have you ordered? I’ll make the move now if it makes sense. If not now, then next turn.[SEP]B:Yeah, you missed me after I&amp;#39;d gone to bed, but as you can see I did make the move on him, and we are apparently spoiling for a fight. Of course, with you reoriented the way you are, seems unlikely you&amp;#39;re on board for continuing that line of discussion.[SEP]A:Well, I’m not completely opposed. I build an army in Venice, after all. What are you thinking?[SEP]B:I mean, the only decision point is Ank/Smy/Con, right? That&amp;#39;s just a matter of choosing the mover - everything else is straightforward one-power tactics[SEP]A:Well, we should really talk to each other more.[SEP]B:Ya think?[SEP]B:FWIW, I&amp;#39;m still on board with cooperating to take down Austria, if that wasn&amp;#39;t obvious[SEP]A:I’m not sure I can save the Bulgarian fleet this turn, but I think you would help yourself by taking Galicia.[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;m not sure you have a vested interest in saving my fleet in any event -you&amp;#39;d much rather be the undisputed fleet power. And that&amp;#39;s just fine.[SEP]A:Well, either way, I can’t help. But I do think you can take Gal without problem.[SEP]B:That was already the plan, and then he walked out anyway. Anyway, my course is both set and obvious, so it&amp;#39;s really just a question of if you&amp;#39;re going to take all the free dots. 😀[SEP]A:Will you be around near the deadline this turn?[SEP]B:Monday at noon ET? Yeah, I should be available around that time.[SEP]A:😎[SEP]A:Hi Russia, still there?[SEP]A:Russia!? Come back![SEP]B:Yes, I&amp;#39;m here[SEP]A:Cool. Any chance you’d like to team up with me and England?[SEP]B:I mean, sure. My goal right now is just to hammer Austria, and that coalition helps further that goal, so...[SEP]A:Cool. I expect Vienna will be empty this turn. Boh - Vie should be a winner.[SEP]A:Ahh...BOH - Vienna. Why’d you try to take it from Gal?[SEP]B:Didn&amp;#39;t log in fast enough to change it. And not really upset about it, either - this way my line is still mostly intact, which is a bit of a priority until you make an overtly anti-Austrian move.[SEP]A:Fair enough. At least you can see that I was sincere.[SEP]B:Aye. As was I. 😀[SEP]A:So, how are things going over there Comrade?[SEP]A:I’m feeling like it’s just about time for you and me to make things official and go steady.[SEP]A:I believe that England would like me to support you to Munich in the Fall. And that’s possible. But perhaps getting you to Budapest might work out better for you? I don’t know — how do you the board right now?[SEP]B:Things are pretty well. Yes, this looks to be the year you can just quietly slip the knife in and take pretty much everything.[SEP]B:And I&amp;#39;m easy either way -no need to make that call right now, as this is the boring turn for me[SEP]A:Well...if I “take everything,” then we end up with a boring, large draw. I’m not in solo position. So, believe it or not, I’d rather you get the spoils out East. If I get much bigger, I’ll be fighting the whole board, and I’ll lose that fight.[SEP]B:Well, damn, guess I can&amp;#39;t bamboozle you into that position then. :)[SEP]A:Eh — I think it’s a better position for you to get a bunch of centers and work as a team anyway. Beats a five-way draw.[SEP]A:Shall we get you Budapest or Munich this year?[SEP]A:I think Austria is likely to try to retake some of his centers this year, so you may have some openings regardless.[SEP]B:Presumably Budapest is the better option, but again I&amp;#39;m not really moving much in the spring, so it&amp;#39;s easy to remain noncommittal on that right this moment. Unless you&amp;#39;re making a hard move right now, which I doubt - you also benefit from the likely ability to just walk in on the fall.[SEP]B:Alright, now it&amp;#39;s specific planning time. And Munich clearly doesn&amp;#39;t seem to make much sense now.[SEP]A:Okay, Let’s get you into Rumania and Budapest this turn. I think I can do that, as Austria wants to take Trieste and Greece, which will open up room to maneuver. As far as I know, Ser is moving to Tri and Bul is moving to Gre. I think that you can take out Bud/Rum with Gal - Bud (supported by Vie) and Sev - Rum (supported by Ukr). The trick will be keeping Sev safe, but I think we can do that too, as I can recommend that Austria self-bounce there to keep me honest.[SEP]A:I am picking up some gains out west, so I risk a severe backlash if I gain anything in the east. I’d love to see you pick up two here and take a bit of the pressure off me.[SEP]B:I can work with that. Grrr. Out tonight, so less stability to chat, but I&amp;#39;m with you here.[SEP]A:👌[SEP]B:Is this thing back on?[SEP]B:Ah, good. Nice run in the West you have going there[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;d probably be trying to push a stop the leader narrative right now, except Mitch hasn&amp;#39;t talked to me since I pointed out that rolling on me was only going to net him two dots before he hit a wall, and that was two or three years ago. So... Eff him. 😀[SEP]A:Sent to Germany, England, Austria, Russia: So, England, Germany, Russia, y’all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would “teach him” and help his along to second place. Then y’all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)[SEP]A:(Part 2) At this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I’m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for “Hey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,” but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that’s really my preference. I am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo. And I’m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I’m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany’s favor. I propose that we draw and hug it out.🤗[SEP]B:I think most of us have the draw set already[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;4th row&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;white-space:pre white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;[CLS]B:Hey italy! good luck this game. I&amp;#39;m guessing you and Austria will be pals, you and France will be rivals?[SEP]A:Well good luck to you too! No idea yet who is a friend. Have you heard anything interesting?[SEP]B:I have some agreements with France. If those are upheld, I&amp;#39;d bet France goes for Por and Spain in 1901. You might want to ask about whether a fleet gets built in Mar during the 1901 build, if you haven&amp;#39;t already, as this would be an indicator of aggression towards you.[SEP]B:Germany seems like a bit of a wild card. Haven&amp;#39;t talked in depth with Austria.[SEP]B:Do you have any sort of aggression in your opening, or are you just planning to be neutral and secure Tun?[SEP]A:You know, I really haven’t decided. I’m trying to get clear answers from my neighbors, and they are all pretty slow to answer. So I really haven’t decided. Is there something you want me to do?[SEP]B:Well definitely make sure you get your fleet to Tun by the fall. I&amp;#39;d like to see you do well, as Italy is kind of the underdog on the map. Have you agreed to France about Piedmont at all?[SEP]A:No, we have not yet talked about Piedmont.[SEP]B:Well, if you&amp;#39;re looking to make France a little nervous, that would be your move. Ven - Pie, Rom - Ven, Nap to TYS.[SEP]B:Then you secure Tun with your fleet in the fall. For the unit in Pie, you can decide to bait France into a bounce in Mar, but then just hold instead. France would move from Spain to Mar and miss securing the fifth supply center. This is certainly aggressive, but it also keeps you and France on a more level playing field.[SEP]A:Well, I’d be inclined to do that if I knew you were moving to the Channel and Wales. If you want for both of us to go all in at the same time, then let’s go.[SEP]B:Yeah, that makes sense. Unfortunately we&amp;#39;ve declared a DMZ in the channel through 1902, so I can&amp;#39;t commit to the stab right now. I still don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s an awful play for you. If France gets a fleet in Mar and has one parked in Spain s.c. at the start of 1902, that&amp;#39;s going to be a little threatening for you.[SEP]A:(1) If you’ve declared a DMZ, then you ARE in position to do this if you want to do it. (2) I’m not going to attack France on my own.[SEP]B:Yeah, everything you&amp;#39;re saying makes sense. When I make specific agreements like the DMZ, I generally try to hold them, especially early game. Honestly, I&amp;#39;d rather the three of us pick apart germany to start. Maybe we could convince France to help you into Munich in the Fall?[SEP]A:Hi England — just sort of checking in to hear how things are going. How does the board look to you right now?[SEP]B:Great time to check in. France and Germany are in conflict, and don&amp;#39;t seem poised to collaborate on invading me, which I&amp;#39;m happy about. Russia&amp;#39;s looking a little troubled with losing Sev. You look poised to lepanto to turkey, and it looks like you&amp;#39;ll pull it off without the Austrian convoy, unless that new fleet is headed west. Also, I feel like you and/or Austria may have your eyes on Munich.[SEP]A:Any thoughts here?[SEP]B:Just about the state of the board? Or did you send a message after mine that didn’t come through?[SEP]A:Ah, I sent a really long message about Germany. You didn’t get it?[SEP]B:Nah. Maybe it was a bot-killer message[SEP]B:Probably best to split it up[SEP]A:Rats.[SEP]A:Here is an image of the message I sent.[SEP]A:I’ve been on pins and needles for two days awaiting a response!!![SEP]B:Haha sorry about that. No image received. The bot may not send them through[SEP]A:Ahhhhhhh![SEP]A:Now I have to retype it👎👎👎[SEP]A:I have kind of an odd favor to ask. And I happen to know it’s in your best interest, but it will require a big picture, long-term sort of view of the game. This is Germany’s very first game of Diplomacy. And he’s clearly in over his head. You’re positioned to smash him. There’s no doubt about that. But the real winner if you do that is France. (End part 1)[SEP]A:France has FOUR armies, and now he has a wide open runway to roll right over Germany. If you help him, you’re going to regret it. Look two game years ahead, France is going to be in a crazy good position. On the other hand, if you change course now and go get France instead, France is NEVER going to be able to build a second fleet. He will be so much easier to destroy. And Germany is so green...he’ll be much easier to take down second. I just...I can see where this is headed. I know it’s attractive just to take that easy build. But that is the apple of knowledge and France is the devilish serpent (end part 2)[SEP]A:I really REALLY believe that it’s better for you and me for you to switch course and take out France now. I’d be happy to help and give you most of the spoils. And I think this would be a great springboard for a dominant England/Italian alliance that can win this game. If only I could get this message to go through.... (End)[SEP]B:All of this is fair. I’m aware that germany’s a first-timer, and I ran through similar reasoning to yours when trying to choose who to side with.[SEP]B:If I had known where you stood in this, it might have swayed my opinion. I was worried about you and austria making a play for Munich and then Russia applying more pressure in the north.[SEP]B:One additional piece of my reasoning is that France is a stronger player than me and others probably know this. After Germany is gone, France is the bigger threat. If Germany and I had taken France together, I would have ended up the bigger threat (i.e. the next target).[SEP]B:I’m going to get Russia in on the German takedown. You really think the three of us can’t handle france together once germany is gone?[SEP]B:Can you tell germany to self-bounce in ruhr? Unless i’m missing something, that line holds until i support into holland (which I haven’t been asked to do yet). The French upside to taking on germany can be contained. If you get Munich out of this, do you still think it’s a bad plan?[SEP]A:I vehemently do not want Munich.[SEP]B:Also i’m wayy wrong it’s a fleet in holland haha[SEP]A:I do think it is a much better plan for both of us to side with Germany against France. I just think that France could pull in Austria or Turkey against me and he could pull in Russia against you. Germany won’t do that sort of counter.[SEP]A:The more I look at this board, the more I want to focus on an E/I Alliance. And I think the only thing standing in our way is France. I don’t see Germany as any kind of obstacle at all.[SEP]A:Especially given that France is locked into armies right now, not fleets, I think we would be wasting a real opportunity if we let France grow a bit more.[SEP]A:I’m sorry I did not come to you with this earlier. That’s just my bad. I’ve been kind of lazy, and I wasn’t really sure I wanted to weigh in about the west at all. But, I’ve changed my mind? I think E/I can dominate here. But we’ve got to keep France from ever building a second fleet. I think that’s the way that both you and me get really big.[SEP]B:I see your points, but a couple of things: 1) France has another build guaranteed this year, and that will likely be a fleet, 2) We may be able to keep France away from all of the German supply centers[SEP]B:Kie and Mun bounce in Ruh, Hol cuts support from Bel. This holds Ruh unless France chooses to send Bel in and let Germany into Holland.[SEP]B:This holds the line unless I give support.[SEP]B:What if Austria gets Munich?[SEP]B:I stabbed Germany, and so I’m hesitant to try collaboration now.[SEP]B:Ok, ok. I’m open to going against france. I messaged germany. We’ll see how she responds. I’m taking denmark this year regardless. The stab on france would involve me taking the channel unexpectedly next spring and helping germany into belgium maybe[SEP]A:These are all good responses. And I get that you don’t want to turn around and stab France now. I do think that I can help you diplomatically with Germany. I think that, if you really want to work with me and Germany, I can get G on board.[SEP]B:Alright, well we can chat next year after builds then. I’m certainly open to it. I told germany to not bother saving denmark (it’s guaranteed for me with Russian support) amd instead do the self bounce in Ruh with Kei and Mun to keep France out, cutting support in Bel with Hol. I think that move is important this fall to keep France out.[SEP]B:France just tried to tell me the Brest build was anti-Italian haha[SEP]A:Funny enough, he tells me it’s anti-English.[SEP]B:Haha. So are we still both anti-French?[SEP]B:I’d like to get germany on board with helping me take the channel (or at least not stopping me). I’m sure germany would be excited to hit me back though :/. I’ll play dumb with France for now[SEP]A:Okay, I’ll try to get Germany on board.[SEP]B:Germany seems on board. Maybe i’m setting myself up to get stabbed. Hope i’m backing the right horse on this one. I’ll shoot for the channel in the spring and then we get germany into belgium. Are you planning to move west?[SEP]B:Was hoping to see something a little more anti-french in your moves. My homeland is toast if you don’t put any pressure on France in the south.[SEP]A:Hi England — I’m sorry for the delay![SEP]A:I can move to attack France in the Spring if you like. For now, I think that mobilizing Germany to attack France is your best bet (and shouldn’t be too hard).[SEP]A:You know what? This isn’t really fair of me. If you will commit to the France attack, I’ll move on him now. Are you ready to go all out against him? This could actually work out really well for both of us.[SEP]B:I’m ready, but i may want your advice on some of the tactics. My plan is to completely cold shoulder France in negotiations and start an attack. We’ll want to get germany on board, but I think Germany is playing a bit neutral for survival purposes right now.[SEP]A:I agree with regard to Germany’s strategy, but I believe he hates France most and he will be with you if both you and I move on France now. France is getting no builds. Let’s just put the clamps on now! I will move to TYS and Tun if you will move either to take Belgium, or to position your fleets at Irish/Channel. If we both take the plunge, there is nothing he can do.[SEP]B:France can support himself into England though, and I think he plans to because he was asking for Germany to cut support in Nth (which she plans not to). The only way to hold the channel is to support from Nth.[SEP]B:into England =&amp;gt; into English channel[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;m planning army yorkshire to wales, which allows for the convoy through the channel next year, and allows me to bounce in Lvp if France moves to IRI[SEP]A:Okay, I buy that. If you commit to moving the army to Wales and you don’t attack Germany, I’ll move on France.[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;m committed. Are you planning to cut support in Munich for a Russian invasion of Berlin?[SEP]A:No way. I am supporting Munich. We don’t want Russia or France rolling over Germany. Germany will give us her centers in time. Let’s keep them German until that time comes.[SEP]A:Can you use Den to cut support in Baltic if I make sure Germany does not retake Den?[SEP]B:Germany has to do something else with Munich? To protect Ruhr I guess?[SEP]B:go team![SEP]A:Cool. Let’s do this.[SEP]B:Are you LYO and WES this Spring with the fleets? And will Venice go to Pie? Also, what is your communication with France like? I&amp;#39;m in favor of all three of us going totally dark on France until the job is done. And at some point we should talk about a fair split of the French supply centers just so there&amp;#39;s no surprises.[SEP]A:Yes, those are my moves.[SEP]A:And I don’t have any dialogue with France right now. I suppose that’s lazy. You want me to stay quiet or try to feel him out? There is no way he will believe anything I say after my last move.[SEP]B:I kind of want to starve him of info. I’m currently giving him radio silence. Germany is getting some inside info, pretending to be friendly, etc. but that will end shortly (assuming I don’t see a surprise german stab of cutting the nth channel support, but i think it’s unlikely).[SEP]B:France apparently plans to move out of Ruh, probably to defend the south. France will lose 1 supply center certainly, maybe 2 this year[SEP]B:What are your thoughts on a divvy up of you in Mar and Spa, me in Bre and Por, and germany in Bel and Par? Just thinking long term about who gets what.[SEP]A:Thanks for that info about France. Also, Germany has confirmed to me that they trust you. I think you’re right that there will be no German stab coming this turn.[SEP]A:As far as that divide, that generally sounds fair. Though, I find that those kinds of agreed splits rarely come to pass exactly as proposed. I may have to turn around and go east if Austria stabs me, etc.[SEP]A:So I’d prefer to kind of focus on general principles: (1) I’d like for the dominant alliance on the board to be E/I. So while I agree we want Germany to help us crack this but, longer term I think we should plan to divide Germany’s share too. The safest divide in that case might leave me with all of Iberia, while you get most of Germany (I.e., you’re going to need armies).[SEP]A:(2) We should focus on parity. In other words, if I’m way ahead on centers when France folds, you get more of France. If it’s the opposite, I get more. We just keep checking in and try to balance both centers and growth opportunities, and let that guide us.[SEP]B:All of that makes sense. We’ll reevaluate as we go. I’d like the promise of Belgium and Paris to Germany to be a consistent one that comes from both of us, for the purpose of maintaining German confidence in our alliance. In case germany asks you.[SEP]B:Looks like you’ve got a bit of a guessing game on your hands.[SEP]A:Yep. Was hoping for a guarantee. 🤨[SEP]B:Germany and I were thinking to go with Spain. France is annoyed enough with me that he honestly may go for the channel. I’ll be risking the channel by supporting ruh to bel with nth. So you can support to spain and then let france into mar from bur instead of bouncing. Germany will try to sneak into bur from Mun, then you two could bounce in Mun to keep russia out. A little complicated, but germany in bur next year would be great for us.[SEP]B:Even if things don’t go our way this fall, france will go eventually. Though the longer france has to stay alive, the longer he’ll have to sweet-talk germany into turning on us[SEP]B:Trieste? What&amp;#39;s up with that?[SEP]B:I guess it shows commitment to an English-Italian alliance, but I&amp;#39;m a little surprised to see a stab like that this soon.[SEP]A:Not a stab. Austria offered it to me for the sake of parity.[SEP]A:Hmmm, maybe I was supposed to keep that a secret? I think you need to give Austria some “thumbs down”[SEP]A:Can you please not go to Austria and tell him that I said the move to Trieste was arranged? He’s obviously trying to manipulate you in some way. Can we just compare notes and try to figure out what he’s up to without revealing that you and I talk much?[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;m not going to right now, but I also am a little curious why it would matter to you if I told Austria that. Are you telling Austria things like &amp;#34;I really want the Austria-Italy alliance to be the dominant one on the board&amp;#34;? What is your long-term plan with Austria?[SEP]A:No — I just want to know what he’s up to. It’s not a big deal to me, but I didn’t know he was going to try to pass that off as him getting stabbed, so I’m curious what he’ll tell you next. If you blow him up for lying to you, we won’t get that info, and he’ll know that you and I talk a lot.[SEP]A:In terms of what I am telling Austria, I am definitely close with him, and I want him to feel like I’m not going to stab him, but we’re almost to the mid game, and cross board alliances work a lot better than neighbor alliances once we get to the mid-game, so I think you can be confident that you’re the long-term ally I want.[SEP]A:That said, I’m definitely saying nice things to Austria too. I won’t deny that. Not the same nice things, but I can’t have Austria thinking I will attack him. That doesn’t help me and I don’t think it helps you.[SEP]B:All of that makes sense. I won&amp;#39;t call out Austria. How do you plan to continue your attack on France this year?[SEP]A:I don’t know. Is there something you’d like me to do? I’m rather flexible. I’d just really like to bust through for a build this year.[SEP]A:Thoughts?[SEP]A:Would you like to support me to MAO?[SEP]B:Won&amp;#39;t France just cut in Bre?[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;d actually like MAO next year.[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;d like to hear something about your plans before midnight[SEP]A:What do you need to know? I won’t move to MAO, I’ll try for Spain or Marseilles. Do you want to know more than that?[SEP]B:Have you been talking to France at all?[SEP]A:Nope. Not a word this phase.[SEP]B:Huh. I guess France is lying to me then?[SEP]A:Yes. I haven’t said a word to him. What’s he saying?[SEP]A:France is a snake.[SEP]B:Umm that you&amp;#39;re the highest ranked online player in the world. And that you consistently encouraged him to attack me.[SEP]A:Well that’s fun. Um, where to begin? I think I’m a good online player. I’ve been playing online for about two years. I have a site ranking on one website in the Top 100, and I have a site ranking on another website in the top 250. So, maybe if you combine those rankings and squint, I’d be in the top 200 or so?[SEP]A:Also, I don’t know who France is. So, he either has me confused with someone, or else he’s just trying to scare you. Let’s see...why would he be trying to scare you?[SEP]A:And, I have definitely encouraged him to attack you, as I recall, but it’s been several game years since then. I feel like you’ve probably encouraged France to attack me before (a fairly natural thing for England to do).[SEP]A:Bottom line: France has every reason in the world to try to get us to distrust each other, and he’s obviously willing to say whatever to make that happen.[SEP]A:I think I’ve been really honest with you, and I think we’ve been helpful to each other, and I think we are both going to succeed in this game if we can stick together and not give in to his tricks.[SEP]A:Cause snakes are gunna snake.[SEP]A:🐍 🐍 🐍 🐍 🐍[SEP]B:All of this pretty much lines up with what I expected, though it’s nice to hear from you. He says that you’re “[redacted]” on playdiplomacy.com . So I guess the user name lining up is just a coincidence. Not that I really care that much btw, but it would be interesting if you were secretly a star player.[SEP]A:I’ve never played on playdiplomacy. I play mostly on an app called Conspiracy. But don’t get me wrong! I’m experienced, and I’ve had some success. I’m not to be trifled with![SEP]A:Also, you should be able to see from my moves, and Austria’s, that I’ve been telling you the truth.[SEP]B:Yeah, that&amp;#39;s fair. France is funny. I&amp;#39;ve gotten maybe 15 messages from France since I ghosted him. Is it rock, paper, or scissors against him this season?[SEP]B:From France: &amp;#34;I can stop Italy this turn by the way. It&amp;#39;s pretty easy since Italy let me into Marseilles, I can support the hold in Marseilles and Marseilles can support MAO to Spain SC. It&amp;#39;s impossible to breach, I&amp;#39;ve checked it, and I can keep making those orders for years and years. You stabbed me in Spring 03. It is Fall 05. I think that you, Italy, and Germany are highly underestimating my ability to survive against your onslaught. You sure this is the game you want? Slowly whittling away at me until I die? Instead, I propose that we let you into the Mid Atlantic Ocean and that you help me defend Italy. I can send you past the MAO into West Med, where you can start taking dots like Tunis or Naples. We wait until AI crumbles, and you have an excellent game where you top the board.&amp;#34;[SEP]B:So I have my interpretation of the message, but I&amp;#39;m curious to hear yours[SEP]A:Hmmm, thanks for sending that. I mean, obviously the orders he proposes can be defeated by tapping Marseilles and supporting into Spain. He knows we know that. He’s just playing games and trying to throw us off.[SEP]B:Yeah. Maybe it&amp;#39;s not even worth thinking about. It&amp;#39;s like the Sicilian in princess bride[SEP]A:Exactly[SEP]A:I’m just going to flip a coin.[SEP]B:So I guess you won&amp;#39;t go for MAO then?[SEP]A:Correct.[SEP]B:(also, there&amp;#39;s a couple other points I&amp;#39;d like to cover while I have you here)[SEP]B:Ok that sounds good. I&amp;#39;m eyeing that for next spring.[SEP]A:Sure.[SEP]B:Well, I&amp;#39;m surprised you haven&amp;#39;t been opinionated at all about my actions in Russia.[SEP]A:Hmmm, well, I do have opinions. I just don’t want to be overbearing.[SEP]A:What are you thinking over there?[SEP]B:The builds are tempting, but I don&amp;#39;t want to be the one that hands austria the game[SEP]B:What are your opinions?[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;m going to bed. But other things I want to talk about are 1) the anti-English moves from Germany, 2) what you&amp;#39;re doing with the Tyr unit.[SEP]A:Responding now.[SEP]A:You are thinking about the right considerations re Russia/Austria. Every build is enticing, but you have to consider the cost. Right now, Russia is basically using all of his units to help you. So, I think you might be better off foregoing that build and keeping Russia on your side for now.[SEP]A:But...I certainly have no horse in that fight.[SEP]A:If you want to attack Russia, no need to hold back on my account.[SEP]A:I do want you to grow so that you and I are the same size. And those Russian centers will be key to that. But they also aren’t going anywhere. I don’t think there is any rush, personally.[SEP]A:The Russian units are doing things you want them to do right now.[SEP]A:Re Germany, I hadn’t really noticed the anti-English moves. She keeps telling me that y’all are very close.[SEP]A:I feel pretty confident that she’s with you, and that she really wants to see France out of the game.[SEP]A:Re Tyrolia, what would you like me to do? I do have a plan with that unit. And if you wanted to deal a blow to Austria, I can think of at least one devious plan to make his turn go poorly.[SEP]B:All that makes sense and I believe it. I feel like your &amp;#34;horse&amp;#34; in the russian front is Austria&amp;#39;s future strength, which could pose a threat to you. Your advice to me is consistent with that.[SEP]A:Yeah, that’s true. I just don’t want to be too nosy or high maintenance, really.[SEP]A:I could see you feeling like you need to get some builds promptly, and so you pick off a Russian unit or two. Even though that may make my situation tougher, I feel like your cooperation against France and later Germany means too much to me for me to try to dictate what you do with Russia.[SEP]A:I hope that makes sense.[SEP]A:But my advice about what you should do really is my opinion about the best way to approach it from your perspective. I don’t think you need to be in a hurry there. I think that just about every place on the board is moving in a positive direction for you right now, and so, if I were you, I would not want to shake that up.[SEP]A:But if you do want to do that, it’s very much okay with me.[SEP]B:Yeah I&amp;#39;m not going for Russia right now. Supposing he can hold the stalemate, he&amp;#39;s literally just saving those territories for me to take at a later date. I will get a little annoyed if the admin cuts us off at 1910 though, as I think my endgame is a little past that.[SEP]B:The anti-english moves aren&amp;#39;t strictly anti-english. But a fleet build in Berlin and then moving to Kie is a little aggressive. Germany hoped I would just give up denmark this fall, and that was her explanation of the kie move. Eventually that Kie fleet will be going against me. A stab right now from germany doesn&amp;#39;t seem to make much sense though.[SEP]B:It would have to be coordinated with france to even have a chance, and with the pressure you&amp;#39;re putting in the south I don&amp;#39;t know how France could afford that. Unless he&amp;#39;s really pissed at me and goes for a kamikaze just to annoy me.[SEP]B:And what devious thing could you do with Tyr that wouldn&amp;#39;t immediately begin aggressions with austria?[SEP]B:Ok now I&amp;#39;m really going to bed. But I can think of a Tyr move that would really stir up some trouble. I wonder if we&amp;#39;re thinking of the same one.[SEP]A:Any chance you are around this morning?[SEP]B:What’s up?[SEP]A:I don’t want to tell Russia a way to deal Austria a blow because Russia will turn around and tell Austria. But I trust you, so I think I could pass on some info to you and you might not use it against me.[SEP]B:Gotcha. What are the moves you’re thinking?[SEP]A:You might say something like this to Russia: I was chatting with Italy about Tyrolia, and he told me that he promised to use Tyrolia to help Austria. My best guess is that Tyrolia and Galicia will bounce in Vienna. If you just use Bohemia to support Tyrolia in, then Austria doesn’t get a build and you likely break up Italy and Austria.[SEP]A:Too devious? 🤭🤫[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;d considered this move as something that russia could do to free up Gal, but I think I thought Ser was a home center or something, so I didn&amp;#39;t realize the build consequence.[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;d bet russia is already planning to do this, but I can make the suggestion[SEP]B:I did have a different move for Tyr in mind.[SEP]A:Oh yeah?[SEP]B:This is not a good idea, i should clarify. But it would be very dramatic if you successfully supported Boh to Mun[SEP]B:(also I have a feeling russia won&amp;#39;t be online before noon unfortunately)[SEP]B:well, russia had the right idea, but didn&amp;#39;t choose the right one to support. Bounce in Ank planned? And congrats on Mar[SEP]A:Yes, both bounces planned. Russia made a nice gamble taking Bulgaria.[SEP]B:Even with Austria in BLA now? I&amp;#39;ll be a little annoyed if I see a build in St. P[SEP]A:Yeah, for sure. Austria loses that build and keeps Vienna vacant. Russia GETS a build. Yeah, I think that worked well for Russia.[SEP]B:We should start talking about the France endgame and what things look like post-war. Maybe after we see the French choice for a disband. I think France hates me the most (despite me having taken none of his territories) and as a result will probably hold onto Brest until the end, or maybe even go for LVP or something.[SEP]A:Sure — I’m happy to talk it through. That move by France to bounce NAO was annoying.[SEP]B:Yeah, I kinda saw that coming. So things are kinda escalating with germany. She’s making lots of asks that I don’t think are reasonable. Like “why not just give me denmark” and “why not just leave Nth open”. She’s also admitted to being friendly with France.[SEP]A:Yeah, I’m hearing rumblings of the same thing from Germany. Just sort of feeling me out on whether I’d be okay with her working with France. Not good.[SEP]A:How would you like to address it with moves this turn? Do you want me to support you to MAO? Or should I move there?[SEP]B:How has she suggested to you that she’ll be helping France? Because if she’s telling you that, it must mean working with france against me, maybe with something specific in mind. She also wants me to give up Brest haha. Maybe i’ll ask if she wants London[SEP]A:I don’t know anything specific. She’s just asking for my thoughts. I have not responded.[SEP]A:Though, I’m not surprised. France is not going to quit. He hasn’t been talking to me anymore and he hasn’t been trying to turn you. That means he’s been working on Germany. I think we just have to keep telling her that France is a Dark Wizard who does not have her best interest in mind.[SEP]B:Yeah, I mean good on France for being persistent. I&amp;#39;m sure France is telling her that we&amp;#39;re allies. And that would actually be the truth. And just geographically it would be hard for me and germany to be allies longer-term, so it&amp;#39;s somewhat understandable that Germany could be swayed by that logic.[SEP]B:What are your thoughts on the timing of war with Germany (if you&amp;#39;re keen on a war in the near future at all)? I have an idea of how to handle the situation that&amp;#39;s slightly dependent on that[SEP]A:Well, I don’t really want to attack Germany this year. In a perfect world, you and I each get a build this year, and we are in position to attack Germany next year.[SEP]A:Germany seems to like my advice, so I may be able to get her to take Paris this year and refrain from attacking you. If we can cripple France in the next two turns, without Germany attacking, then next year’s attack on Germany would be easy.[SEP]A:That is my general thinking in it.[SEP]B:I mean I don&amp;#39;t see how I get a build this year outside of moving in on Russia, but I&amp;#39;d rather stay out for now. Honestly the worst that Germany can do this year is knock me out of the channel.[SEP]B:So I don&amp;#39;t want support into MAO this turn. I might reach out to France with a proposition for survival that I won&amp;#39;t follow through with. But maybe I can make it convincing enough that he gives it a shot. Otherwise I&amp;#39;m rather nervous that France gives Germany a big hand with attacking my island in his final years[SEP]B:Also, will an attack on Germany really be easy next year?[SEP]B:Also, did you tell germany i was plotting against her? She says you did.[SEP]A:Whoa — no, I want you and Germany to work together.[SEP]A:I would not and have not said you are plotting against her. She floated the “work with France thing,” and I suggested that she should really take Paris now while she can.[SEP]A:If we can get Germany to take Paris, next year will be much easier. I think we should both direct her there.[SEP]B:You really said nothing to that effect? What would prompt france to say that to me? It’s ok if you did say something, but i want you to be honest about it.[SEP]B:Some exciting moves. Will be curious to see where you stand.[SEP]A:Hey — sorry I’ve been offline since the bot went down. That looks like a pretty aggressive move from Germany. I wonder if France has pocketed her. I do like the move to Paris, but the rest is not good.[SEP]B:Yeahh. It’s a shame. I mean i’m aware at this point that the two of you could choose to mow over me. I hope the expanse in northern russia makes you wary of helping germany though.[SEP]B:Time for survival mode. Will appreciate some advice on tactics if you’re on my side of this.[SEP]A:Yeah, I’m on your side. I’ll help on tactics, but I think the real key here is getting Germany to flip back. I don’t see why that move has to be permanent. I think you should tell her something like this: “Look, I see that you are attacking you, but I think it’s my fault not yours. I should have given you back Denmark. I see that now. And I’m sorry. I will move out peaceably, and I hope we can work out a new working relationship.”[SEP]A:Just say you’re sorry. She can take it back anyway, might as well offer it back right?[SEP]A:(And I’m not saying you have anything to be sorry for, I’m just trying to brainstorm about what will help you turn her back to your side.)[SEP]B:I already responded non-angrily, though not specifically what you said. I think a return of denmark could go a long way. Though that border will make things tense, and i don’t think peace with her could last forever[SEP]B:One thing I&amp;#39;m curious about: Why would you want Germany and I to be friends? Aren&amp;#39;t you better off with both of us fighting? And I can keep Denmark this fall if I give up the channel (which may fall anyways)[SEP]A:Well, I want to be rid of France. I’ve really been depending on the two of you to help in that project. If England decides to move out of Paris for France, that’s bad for me. Also, I don’t want to see Germany get two builds this turn. But you’re right, if it’s inevitable anyway, it’s not the end of the world. #teamengland[SEP]B:I sure hope you’ve not been clicking that thumbs down haha. It would be a brutal stab. I suppose i’ve got to place my trust somewhere though. Why choose me instead of germany?[SEP]B:You know, if you&amp;#39;re able to lend a hand from MAO, I&amp;#39;m actually not in THAT bad of shape. Can I depend on that?[SEP]A:1) You’ve been straight with me all game. 2) You have a much better ability to read the board than she does. 3) You’re on the other side, so you can’t really stab me, but I could totally see her moving to Tyrolia some time soon. 4) You’re not in France’s pocket.[SEP]B:All good reasons. Also, I think Germany is gonna ghost me, soooo, friends? I need MAO to attack Bre. Can you do that?[SEP]A:I will ensure that Brest can’t hurt you. Not sure yet if I’ll cut that support or get France to do something weird with it, but you can consider that unit non functional this turn. I’ll also see what intel I can gain.[SEP]B:Cool. You really think you can get france to take your advice on Brest?[SEP]B:And do you have opinions about russia walking into Mun?[SEP]A:Re Brest: if I’m not confident, I’ll just cut that support. I know that one is important to you, and I’ll make sure it’s taken care of.[SEP]A:Re Munich: that one never really crossed my mind. But if you can get Russia to do that, it would be awesome. I don’t want to see Germany get builds here.[SEP]B:Cool. Any advice on the rest of tactics for my defense? I have my own ideas, but would be curious to hear your opinion[SEP]A:I’d probably just use the army to protect Liverpool. I’d send NAO to Norwegian if the battle is going to be against Germany. And I’d flip a coin between supporting Channel to Belgium or supporting Denmark holding.[SEP]A:And I wouldn’t tell anyone the result of that coin flip. There is just no reason to share that info.[SEP]B:Huh. That&amp;#39;s way different than what I had in mind.[SEP]A:Well, you’re closer to it than I am. I’m sure you’ve taken a much harder look. What am I missing?[SEP]B:You&amp;#39;re not missing anything, but I had a more defensive strategy in mind I guess. I&amp;#39;ve got some time to think it over. Please do let me know what intel you receive[SEP]B:Hi, I have a different ask of the MAO unit actually, if you&amp;#39;re around this morning.[SEP]A:Hey — what’s up?[SEP]B:I want to see whether supporting channel to Bre is an option for MAO you&amp;#39;d consider. And I&amp;#39;d also want to know if Gas support will be cut.[SEP]A:Well, have to just be honest here — I’ve been working on a larger plan considering your earlier request that I neutralize Brest, and I’m not sure that change works in the larger scheme.[SEP]A:More broadly, is there any chance you’d like to form a trio and work with me and Russia long term?[SEP]B:Why wouldn&amp;#39;t you let me in on your larger plan?[SEP]B:And does your larger plan include neutralizing Brest, or did it just consider that I asked that? Can you confirm you&amp;#39;re neutralizing Brest by attacking it from MAO?[SEP]A:Yes, hitting Brest. I prefer not to share my moves if they don’t matter to someone else. There is just less chance that something goes wrong, and less chance I end up blaming someone else if something goes wrong.[SEP]A:What do you think about E/I/R as a trio?[SEP]B:I think you need to justify to me why supporting into Brest isn&amp;#39;t an option. I don&amp;#39;t see how this could be relevant to some larger plan. Unless the plan is &amp;#34;don&amp;#39;t give England that build, don&amp;#39;t show others that I&amp;#39;m supporting England&amp;#34;[SEP]A:Wow. Well, you asked me to do something else earlier, and I have spent days trying to fit your earlier request into my move set.[SEP]A:But, you know what, it’s more important to me to have you as an ally. So I’ll support you to Brest.[SEP]B:I obviously would like that. But to be honest I care less about the support and more about the secret.[SEP]A:So, confirmed, MAO supporting Channel to Brest.[SEP]A:Test.[SEP]A:It’s not a secret. It’s just that I like to keep my moves secret unless they matter to someone.[SEP]B:Can you confirm whether support from Gas is cut as well?[SEP]A:I am not currently cutting support in Gascony.[SEP]B:Ok. And I&amp;#39;m down to chat about russian relations after the move. Sorry for the last-minute change here. But germany&amp;#39;s been putting pressure on me[SEP]A:Have to say — I expect Germany to use Paris to support Brest. Those two seem to be in lockstep now.[SEP]A:Are you sure that I should just take Portugal to drop England down to 1 unit?[SEP]A:I mean drop France down to 1 unit.[SEP]B:France is just going to bounce you out, right? What else does it make sense for the Spa unit to do?[SEP]A:He thinks I am supporting an attack on Spain and moving to Burgundy, so I think his moves look like this: Spain hold Gas S Spa holding Paris S Brest Brest S MAO - Channel (he asked me to take it) Irish - Liv[SEP]B:Hmm, yeah I would have thought he would assume the Gas support would be cut. Does France really hate you the least?[SEP]A:Yeah, I think France trusts that I’m actually going to Channel and Burgundy here.[SEP]B:I will admit I&amp;#39;ve communicated with Germany about your plan to use MAO to help me. That may have made its way back to France[SEP]A:I feel like you, Germany, and France: if I tell anyone anything, it circulates to all three.[SEP]B:Yeahh. I maybe should keep my mouth shut more often.[SEP]A:Germany says that the Brest thing relates to Denmark. Anyway, what should we do?[SEP]B:It does. I&amp;#39;m giving up denmark for support to Brest.[SEP]A:Okay, I’ll support you to Brest.[SEP]B:Sounds great[SEP]B:Thanks[SEP]B:Glad to see that go through.[SEP]B:Told you about the move to Por btw[SEP]A:You were right. Thank you.[SEP]B:Well I&amp;#39;m glad to see the takedown work out. I suppose France has one more unit, but Por will fall next year. And now things get even more interesting. Signing off for now.[SEP]A:Hmmm, interesting French disband. He wants me to support him to Brest. Have to believe he’s going to have Germany on his side given the German fleet build. Thoughts on how to approach this? We should be able to defeat them if we stick together.[SEP]A:I think we should focus on getting your army to Pic this turn, and I can support you to Paris in the Fall.[SEP]A:DO NOT DISCUSS PLANS WITH GERMANY THIS TURN. Seems very clear that she’s coming for you based on the build and the French disband. I don’t think we help ourselves by speaking with her. Let’s just get you into Paris, secure North Sea, and get moving.[SEP]A:I don’t need any builds in the North. If I get bigger, I’ll have a target on my back. So I’m just going to help you get up to my level.[SEP]A:Also, I need to decide to work with Russia or Austria in the East. What’s your preference?[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;ll be in communication with Germany, but I&amp;#39;ll agree to not share any specific plans discussed between the two of us this turn. Is that fair?[SEP]A:Yes of course. I don’t mean that you shouldn’t talk to her at all.[SEP]B:At first glance, I prefer an alliance with Russia, though I understand this means you breaking a relationship with Austria. Mostly this is because Russia can threaten me if he ever goes north. What&amp;#39;s your preference?[SEP]A:Well, that’s fine with me. I like Russia. But here is the downside for you: if Russia grows, the north won’t be undefended any more, and you will have less room to grow. So, think long term, and think about where your dots are going to come from. I mean it sincerely when I say that I’ll join up with either one provided you feel good about it, but I actually think it might be better for you if I give back Austria a couple of centers and position you to grab Swe and STP once Germany is on her heels.[SEP]B:Those are good points. I suppose you&amp;#39;d like to commit to this before moves this evening?[SEP]B:*commit one way or the other[SEP]A:Yeah, I think we should make a plan.[SEP]A:I’d like to have your final thoughts on A/R as quickly as possible so that I have time to execute a plan. But I understand if you want time to think about it.[SEP]A:How is Germany treating you right now? Did she tell you about that fleet build before it happened? Seems like a bad sign, and North Sea is awfully exposed.[SEP]B:Oh she told me that she plans to line the whole northwest coast with fleets because &amp;#34;they&amp;#39;re more versatile there&amp;#34;. But all they can do from the northwest coast is invade me.[SEP]B:She also said she wants Brest eventually.[SEP]B:Not sure if I can keep Nth this year. We&amp;#39;ll see if I can keep it friendly. That involves lots of talk about moving against you. She wants to see me in MAO.[SEP]A:Yeah, look, I don’t mind if you tell her that you’re moving against me. I am telling her that I’m moving against you. Let’s please make the following deal: You and I both plot with Germany as if we’re attacking each other. And we both share the plan with Germany against the other guy with each other, and we pledge to tell Germany (and France if he asks) that you and I are not talking much, we don’t trust each other, and we don’t have any plan in place.[SEP]A:This turn will work best if we share all info that we learn from G/F, and we pledge to keep our own talks secret.[SEP]A:I think that we can pull off a great turn, but it won’t work if G/F get catch wind of our alliance.[SEP]B:All that makes sense. I&amp;#39;m on board. You know, if Germany just stopped surprising me with aggressive moves, she may have won my favor. [sigh][SEP]B:And I think Austria is the ally we choose. If we hold off Germany, she can only expand into Russia, which would be her only friend. And the trusting relationship you have makes it more likely that things will go through.[SEP]A:👌[SEP]A:So, here is the plan that Germany is telling me: She wants to ensure she gets North Sea. So she is asking for this: Den S Bel - North Bel - North Hol - Bel Pic - Channel Spa - Gas Par S Sap - Gas MAO - Irish[SEP]A:She wanted me to support her direct from Paris to Brest, but I convinced her that you would likely fear a forced disband, so you were likely to try to keep me out of Gascony (thus Par S Spa - Gas).[SEP]A:I don’t think we can save North Sea this turn, but if we can land your army in Pic, we can force France to retreat to Belgium, which would be absolutely awesome. And I think his survival instinct would kick in at that point, and he would stay there until you take it.[SEP]B:I may be able to save Nth with some diplomacy. Is it worth me trying to make Germany a hard case to be on my side? Does that just make her moves less predictable?[SEP]A:So I would suggest this: Bre S Wal - Pic Wal - Pic Channel Convoy Wal - Pic That means Germany will lose Paris and Belgium this year. And I think you can defend your territory even with G in North Sea.[SEP]A:I really think that we are best off not suggesting that you and I are talking. If Germany gets any idea that I shared her plans with you, we’ll have no idea what they are going to do.[SEP]B:Uhh, Germany will just hop into one of my home centers from Nth in the fall...[SEP]A:I trust you at this point, but I don’t think that confronting her is the best move here.[SEP]A:No, you can defend.[SEP]B:Oh move to Cly?[SEP]B:Oh wait Nth just retreats. whoops[SEP]A:You can move NAO to Norwegian in Spring, and retreat North to Norway. Then in Fall you cover London with Channel while I support you to Paris.[SEP]A:Right.[SEP]A:So you have coverage for every center, and you get the build, while G loses two.[SEP]B:Thoughts on a retreat to Hel?[SEP]A:That’s the best I can come up with if G is being honest with me.[SEP]A:I would not be opposed to a retreat to Hel, but it depends a lot on what the board looks like. I’m not crazy about Germany taking Norway. We want her taking units off the board.[SEP]B:Well I&amp;#39;ll at least communicate with Germany to the point that she thinks I&amp;#39;m genuinely against you. But I won&amp;#39;t ask for any favors.[SEP]B:If I do I&amp;#39;ll let you know, and we should expect that you hear about them.[SEP]A:Agreed. Yes, I’m totally fine with that. We want G thinking that we’re working against each other.[SEP]A:And, frankly, she’s going to be pissed at me after this move, so I wouldn’t mind if you lied to her too at the same time to spread that out a bit.[SEP]A:So plot away against me, but tell me what plan you guys work out, so we can talk about what she’s most likely to do.[SEP]B:France wants me to go for MAO. I&amp;#39;m going to say I&amp;#39;m on board with that. I&amp;#39;ll say NAO is going there.[SEP]B:I mean germany[SEP]A:Yep. That makes sense. She wants Edi and Norway clear.[SEP]B:Also, does it matter so much if Germany is mad at both of us? Isn&amp;#39;t it basically war in the Fall?[SEP]A:If I were you, I’d order NAO to Norwegian. From Norwegian, you have a play to defend Norway AND Edi. Which means you could retreat to Helg if you like and you have a 50/50 to defend Norway or Edi.[SEP]B:Yeah that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ll order[SEP]A:Re G being mad: it’s not the end of the world. I mean, we’ll definitely be at war with her. I just don’t want her trying to throw the game in spite or anything like that. Cause I am lying to her like crazy this turn. 🤭🤫[SEP]B:yeahh... it happens. i&amp;#39;ve been fortunate to not really have to lie so far.[SEP]B:What are your thoughts on Mun?[SEP]B:Also, just out of curiosity, did you advise Germany to build the Kiel fleet?[SEP]A:I absolutely did not advise G to build the F Kie.[SEP]A:We did not talk at all about that build.[SEP]A:Thoughts on Mun? What do you mean?[SEP]A:If G would have asked, I would have said that two armies would make me a bit uncomfortable, but I would not have insisted on a fleet, as two armies would have been more anti-Russian than anything. But she did not ask me.[SEP]B:I believe you. I just was curious. And I didn&amp;#39;t look closely enough at Mun. Ber can just support. But I thought it might be interesting to work with Russia there, even if Russia isn&amp;#39;t the long-term ally.[SEP]B:Also, who does germany think the third ally is?[SEP]B:I ask because we may be interested to know whether Germany will try to sneak into Swe or not.[SEP]A:Well, I’m not next to Munich now, so there isn’t much I can do about that. Maybe in the Fall.[SEP]A:Germany and I have not discussed a third ally. She doesn’t give the impression that she cares much about the east.[SEP]B:I guess the question in spring is whether you move to Tyr. And would we want her moving into Russia? If she goes east and annoys her future only friend on the board, this might complicate their future relations.[SEP]A:Well, that’s a great idea. I am all for her moving on Russia if you can accomplish that. I’m certainly willing to go to Tyrolia.[SEP]B:Alright. I&amp;#39;ll plant the seed about anti-russia stuff. If she thinks you&amp;#39;re a friend, though, she may listen to you more than me.[SEP]A:FYI, she just asked me if I am talking with you. I told her: “I am wary of England right now. He just asked me what I want to do this turn. I feel like he’s trying to get me to leave MAO open.”[SEP]B:Cool. consistent with my messaging. I&amp;#39;m talking about a plan to leave Bre open and get her support to Gas so I can support into Spa. I&amp;#39;m asking for her to promise Bre to France and then bounce in Bre instead.[SEP]B:Then I&amp;#39;d dislodge in MAO and you&amp;#39;d retreat to IRI. We&amp;#39;ll see what she thinks. I imagine she&amp;#39;s just playing along, But I need to make specific plans to be believable[SEP]A:💯[SEP]B:Looks like germany is staying friendly with russia. Can we go over moves one more time so i can be sure we’re on the same page?[SEP]A:Here is what I have down right now: MAO S Brest WES S MAO LYO - TYR S Spa - Gas Pie - Mar Ven - Tyr Nap - ION[SEP]B:Cool. All expected. Right now I&amp;#39;m: NAO to NWG NTH hold Wal to Pic Channel convoy wal to pic Bre support Wal to Pic[SEP]A:I like it. As I think about it more, you may be better off moving North to Holland, expecting a bounce there. I think you’re slightly better off keeping the German fleet in Kiel, as it’s one less German unit in North Sea, but it’s not a huge difference either way.[SEP]B:That&amp;#39;s good advice. I&amp;#39;ll take it[SEP]A:I’m kind of excited about this turn.[SEP]B:A stab is always exciting[SEP]A:I’m sorry mate. You’ve been a terrific ally. First class all the way. But on this turn, Germany made the kind of offer I could not refuse, and so I went for it.[SEP]A:I know that doesn’t make it any easier, but I really mean it when I say that you’ve played a strong game, and been an excellent ally.[SEP]B:No worries, nicely played on your end. I think I can top Germany’s offer if you’re interested. Let me know![SEP]A:Hmmmm...I’m intrigued. Aren’t you supposed to be screaming obscenities at me right now?This response is downright classy and sportsmanlike.[SEP]B:Haha yeah I suppose. But this game for me is about learning. I’m relatively new to the game, and I volunteered for the study 1) to help out my friend, and 2) to prep for an in-person game I have on August 11. So if I get the right experience from this game and do well in the in-person game (i.e. win bragging rights among my friends), I’ve won MY game. Here is my offer: You bring me along to second place, I vow to help you solo as Italy, and you teach me how you pulled it off. What do you say?[SEP]A:Well that is a better offer than Germany’s. One of the best offers I’ve ever received. And I really mean it when I say that you’re a joy to play with and a strong ally. I’d be happy to teach you as much as I can.[SEP]A:I suggest you retreat to Skagerrak to put maximum pressure on Germany.[SEP]B:Well i’m happy to learn if you’re willing to teach. Do we have a deal then? This is obviously something you’ll have to trust me with. But I haven’t lied tp you yet and don’t intend to. And i imagine you can tactically keep me in a position where i’m not a threat. Also, on the teaching side of things I may have some questions about earlier in the game to learn how you set things up (and I would expect genuine answers!)[SEP]B:And yeah, that retreat makes sense. You think norway and the home island are too defensive?[SEP]A:I’ll answer anything you ask honestly.[SEP]A:You have more options from Skag, and she can’t cover them all. You have a much higher upside from there, and it might be worth it for you to take Sweden to avoid having to disband.[SEP]A:Regarding your offer: it may be hard to put you in second place, frankly. If your units are doing things that help me, then I’ll try to keep your units on the board, and I definitely won’t allow you to be eliminated, but it’s really hard for me to ensure that you place second.[SEP]B:I can settle for survival. Deal.[SEP]B:Your reasoning on Skag makes sense. Going to bed now. First question on strategy is: how frequently dp you tell lies, and what are the typical circumstances?[SEP]A:Hmmm, well, you know, we’ll have statistics to help answer that question at the end of the game. I’d say that I am mostly honest, and I place a lot of value on my credibility. I’m not going to lie about my moves to someone unless I am going to get a huge advantage out of it. But I spend most of the game trying to make everyone else on the board feel that I’m their closest ally, so a lot of what I say is a shade on the truth.[SEP]A:So, I found it hard to decide whether to use a thumbs up or thumbs down quite a lot. Most of the time, there is some truth in what I’m saying, but I am trying to persuade the other player to do something for reasons I am not telling them.[SEP]A:So, in general, I’m not afraid to lie, but I am very afraid of getting caught lying. I try to preserve my credibility as best I can, but if I am setting up a stab, I will tell some serious whoppers.[SEP]A:Also, that thing France said about my past successes: that was true. I do have a lot of experience and I have had a fair amount of success playing online diplomacy. I just did not want you thinking of me that way.[SEP]A:I’ll also note, just cause I have nobody else to talk with about this: I worked REALLY hard on this last move. Germany wanted to take Brest, but if that happened, it would have cut support and prevented your army from leaving your island. So I had to convince Germany to support France to Brest, without telling her the real reason why. And I needed you to go to NAO so that you could not guard Liverpool. There were so many lies!🤞😱[SEP]A:And that doesn’t even include the East![SEP]A:To be completely honest, I directed just about everyone else’s moves on that turn! Russia is the one exception, but I basically knew what he was going to do. The best advice I have for someone who wants to get better at Diplomacy: just work hard. You can win by putting in more time and effort than everyone else. I have success by writing a lot to everyone all the time.[SEP]B:Yeah that’s one thing about online diplomacy I have mixed feelings about. It seems like there’s definitely a benefit from putting a lot of time in. I feel like I’ve been putting a lot of time in as it is, but there’s been the temptation to put in more. For in-person everybody gets the same amount of time to chat, which can be an equalizer in some ways.[SEP]B:I had considered what a stab from you might look like before it happened, and I was like “is he really going to all that trouble” but I suppose you were. Care to share why you chose Germany and how early you made that choice? What was the “offer”?[SEP]B:And that’s cool that i’m playing with a champ![SEP]A:Hi England — so I see that you retreated to Norway. Not what I expected, but it can work. Would you still like to work with me?[SEP]B:Yeah i know we didn’t chat about this. It was a little last minute, and you hadn’t responded in the morning so I didn’t think you were around (also I thought Ska was more a suggestion). I should have given you a heads up. My thinking was 1) it’s going to Sweden anyways, 2) i thought it might help warm relations with germany. Was this a bad call?[SEP]B:I would still like to work with you[SEP]A:Not a big deal at all.[SEP]A:I suggest that you take Sweden, and I’m working on getting Belgium this turn too. It’ll be tricky to keep Germany from defending it, but I’m going to try.[SEP]B:Pic to Bel?[SEP]B:And you were a bit shy about the earlier learning question. I guess it may be something sensitive to give an honest answer to at this time. One other question I have is whether there&amp;#39;s a mistake you&amp;#39;ve seen in my play that you think I could have done differently. Like choosing to cold-shoulder France or choosing not to sneak into Sweden earlier.[SEP]B:Also, France is asking about our relations after the stab. What would you like me to say?[SEP]A:Something about how awful I am and how much you want revenge?🤭[SEP]B:Haha alright. I’ll keep you “aBrest” of how France will move that fleet (should he choose to share)[SEP]A:Okay, I think we have a good move brewing![SEP]A:If you’re sincerely on board, this will be fun![SEP]A:France is ordering Brest to Channel. Germany is ordering Burg S Bel and convoying Holland to Yorkshire....![SEP]A:So here is the move: Norway - Swe Pic S Channel - Belgium Mar - Bur to cut support Gas to Bre to block the Paris move. I think you’re going to get a build this turn even if I take Liverpool. Does that make sense?[SEP]B:Yeah I&amp;#39;m on board, though I will remind you that you&amp;#39;re forgetting an important part of the bargain. So I guess NWG to Edi (which is probably safe in case she goes for the build instead) and then plan to build in London?[SEP]A:What part of the bargain am I forgetting? It’s unintentional. I’m trying to be helpful![SEP]B:You overlooked a couple of my questions.[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve been busy setting up that move, so it&amp;#39;s no big deal, just wanted to remind you[SEP]A:Sorry.[SEP]A:You asked a question about what Germany offered me. Do you mind if I answer that after this move? I’d just like to see for sure that you’re sincere in working with me after I so rudely stabbed you.[SEP]B:Yeah that one&amp;#39;s fair to skip for now I think.[SEP]A:Germany is now fishing for info from me about our relationship. Does she know that we are still talking? I’d like to tell her that you’re mad at me and you will tell me nothing, but we must keep our stories straight.[SEP]B:No, but I&amp;#39;d bet she&amp;#39;d assume it. We didn&amp;#39;t have much to say to each other this morning. I tried to be friendly but she was kinda straight up about saying that an alliance wasn&amp;#39;t going to work out. And I sent a message back but haven&amp;#39;t heard anything. So I&amp;#39;d imagine she&amp;#39;d think I&amp;#39;m not just sitting here twiddling my thumbs. Up to you how to spin it though.[SEP]A:Thank you. 👌[SEP]B:I&amp;#39;m going to be hit or miss with connectivity this evening, so I&amp;#39;m putting moves in now. Will look just before the adjudication though. But I&amp;#39;m trying to get some work done. So right now I&amp;#39;m: Eng to Bel, Pic support Eng to Bel, Nwy to Swe, and NWG to Edi.[SEP]A:👍[SEP]A:I’ll let you know if anything changes on my end.[SEP]B:Cool, sounds good[SEP]A:Hmmm, Germany is backing off the bait. I think we will have to change our plan.[SEP]B:What&amp;#39;s up?[SEP]A:Not sure yet, but she is not going to leave Belgium unguarded so that won’t work.[SEP]B:Alright, keep me posted.[SEP]A:She is pressing hard now for info from me on your moves. I am telling her that you are jovial with me, but that we have not discussed any substance.[SEP]B:👍[SEP]B:France is offering to move in a way that would help against you. Does it matter what I say?[SEP]A:I don’t think it matters. I believe he is lying to you.[SEP]B:Okay. Cause you had said he’d be going to the channel before. Is that still true? And any update on belgium?[SEP]A:Working on it. I’ll have an update in an hour.[SEP]B:Ok. I’ll be asleep probably, but i’ll see in the morning.[SEP]A:So, it sounds to me like Germany thinks you are coming for her and she will not leave Belgium unguarded. I think your best bet will be the following: Picardy - Brest (expect a bounce) Channel - London (expect that The French fleet will move to the Channel, which will mean you don’t lose Brest, Norwegian to Edi (just in case) Norway to Sweden I was hoping for a better move involving taking Belgium, but I just don’t think I can swing it. Thoughts? What are you hearing now from France and Germany?[SEP]B:Long one from Germany. Talking up your evils, talking collaboration with France. Suggested moves are NWG to Cly, holland to york, eng goes to iri or wales, belgium supports brest to channel. Pic to bre, par to pic, bur to par, mun to bur.[SEP]B:Haven’t responded yet. Will have a somewhat busy morning, so i’ll appreciate your guidance if you think this changes anything[SEP]A:Thank you. Just woke up. Thinking about this. Any ideas?[SEP]A:Seems like she’s going to try to take Brest for herself.[SEP]A:I think you tell her “yes,” but then order Pic to Bre and Channel to London. That way France moves out of Brest, and you bounce Germany in Brest and keep it.[SEP]A:And I’d stick with NWG to Edi and Norway to Sweden.[SEP]A:And by the way: Thank you very much for filling me in. Makes me feel really confident that you’re with me.[SEP]B:Yeah, happy to help. Just got online now. Let me take a moment to process all of this.[SEP]B:Ok,first question: You&amp;#39;re saying she&amp;#39;s going for Bre on her own, but she&amp;#39;s suggesting Pic to Bre. Maybe she&amp;#39;s hoping for you to support Paris in?[SEP]A:Hmmm, no, she does not expect my support. But I’m surprised she’s screwing over France.[SEP]B:Well, do you think she&amp;#39;s being honest with me?[SEP]A:It’s really hard for me to say. I know she is eager for her own builds, so my best guess is that she’s being partially honest with you and that she is going to grab London or Edi if she feels confident you are not going to cover.[SEP]B:Yeah, the suggestion of going to Cly is consistent with that. And that the channel moves away from london[SEP]B:I think your suggestion makes sense. Covering Edi and London is safe, and Germany seems a bit unpredictable. And I keep fingers crossed that France indeed will vacate Brest[SEP]B:And, since you haven&amp;#39;t been specific on your plan for Lvp, I can only assume that you&amp;#39;ll be moving there.[SEP]A:I am planning to move to Liverpool. I’m sorry that costs you a unit. But the way this is going, it may very well be the last center I take from you, and I think it’s much more likely now that you take second place.[SEP]B:Ok gotcha. Hmm I just realized that I really have to hope for a bounce in Edi or London. Because If I get Bre and Swe, I would get a build even with you in Lvp, but then I wouldn&amp;#39;t have an open home supply center to build at[SEP]A:Well, you’re right about that. Perhaps ask Germany to bounce with you in Edi?[SEP]A:Though, I don’t think you’ll be getting a build now because you’re unlikely to get Belgium. But...if you think Germany is really convoying to Yorkshire, I’m willing to order Marseilles to Burgundy to cut support while you support Channel to Belgium.[SEP]B:If I get Bre and Swe, but you get Lvp, I&amp;#39;m still net up by one (it will be rebuilding the disbanded fleet that was in Bre).[SEP]A:Brest is already English.[SEP]B:Yeah. But I get the unit back is all I mean. I&amp;#39;m down to 4 now.[SEP]B:I have 5 centers and 4 units now. Add Swe, hold Bre, take away Lvp, and I&amp;#39;ve got another unit to put on the board[SEP]B:But only if I have a free home supply center[SEP]A:Ah, you’re totally right. My mistake.[SEP]A:This is getting tricky.[SEP]B:Haha yeah. Given your comms with France, would it make sense that she&amp;#39;s being genuine with me?[SEP]A:It’s possible. But I just don’t know.[SEP]A:I’d be really surprised if she wanted to cut out France at this point.[SEP]B:Yeah, I think I have to play defensive then. I actually think aggression from her is more likely. I would be surprised if neither london or edi bounce. I&amp;#39;ll say I agree to her proposal though.[SEP]A:Okay, I think that’s the right move. This is the first turn in a while that is fairly unpredictable from my point of view. It would be really great if you wind up with a build.[SEP]A:Well played.[SEP]A:So do I get ghosted now after you duped me?[SEP]A:If your strategy is not to talk to me again, I’d appreciate if you would at least let me know that, as a courtesy. Just trying to play a board game here.[SEP]B:Hey, no not going to be a dick. I have agreed to not talk to you.[SEP]A:Okay. I think that is a bad choice in any game of Diplomacy (and likely in any game in general), and it only helps other people. But I’ll respect your choice if that is how you want to play. If you do ever decide you want to talk, my door will always be open, no matter what. And I am willing to keep all communications secret, if that’s the issue.[SEP]B:Love is a game. And it’s wise to stay away from your ex if the relationship was toxic[SEP]A:I mean...you encouraged me to go for the solo, and then pulled the rug out from under me. I see why you did what you did. But...I’m not going to solo now. Eventually the incentives will change. I never close a door because things change turn to turn. Closing our door is only good for Germany. So...it makes sense that she made you promise to close it.[SEP]B:Ok there’s something I want to share on the consition that this and future communications are just between the two of us. Think you can do that?[SEP]A:Absolutely. The moment I try to share something with Germany, she would say it to you, so you can be sure I’ll keep anything confidential.[SEP]B:Welll there’s a bit of an out of game thing affecting my play on some matters. And I kind of want to leave this vague since this will be in a dataset and whatever. But after the stab i thought the least i could do was make you aware.[SEP]A:What is the out of game thing?[SEP]B:I have a neighbor who I&amp;#39;d really rather not brutally backstab, and it&amp;#39;s not you (clearly). Does that make sense?[SEP]A:Sure.[SEP]B:So what will you do if you won&amp;#39;t solo?[SEP]A:Well, the solo is clearly off the table. Without your help I never would have made that play in the east. I am outnumbered there and I will slowly melt away.[SEP]A:So, I will lose some centers and try to find someone who wants to work with me.[SEP]B:Well, it sounds like you mean the solo right now. You don’t think an eventual solo is off the table for you, right?[SEP]A:Eh, anything can happen, but I’m not really motivated to do that at this point. I’d accept a draw right now if everyone was on board.[SEP]B:You know, I might be in the same boat there. This game has invaded my life enough as it is. I think I prefer in-person. It&amp;#39;s a long day, but when it&amp;#39;s done it&amp;#39;s done. Although you don&amp;#39;t really get the fresh start you do with online (things like &amp;#34;i remember what you did to me last time&amp;#34; come up when playing with friends)[SEP]A:My five-way draw vote is up. If you can rally the troops, we can get to the interesting stats![SEP]B:I mean isn’t this getting called off in 1910 anyways? That’s when the study ends. And how does the draw vote work? Do people see what you voted if it doesn’t go through?[SEP]B:Do your other moves not go through if you propose a draw?[SEP]A:I’m not sure how the draw vote works on Backstabbr. I don’t know if it’s visible. But I believe you just have to go down to the scroll bar at the bottom that says “Solo Victory” and scroll down to “five-way draw.”[SEP]B:Well, I’ll see what I can do then. The alternative is that we just duke it out for another couple of years until admin calls it.[SEP]A:Austria sounds game for a draw.[SEP]B:Haha no surprise there. Just reached out to russia. Germany is sworn to fight against you till the end (though a stab against me is inevitable too). But maybe we can convince if all others are on board[SEP]B:Russia on board. Germany is the last holdout. Doesn&amp;#39;t believe we&amp;#39;ll draw, or maybe doesn&amp;#39;t want to. I&amp;#39;d really also like to get people to mark &amp;#34;Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders&amp;#34; as well, just to get it over with.[SEP]A:I don’t really know what Germany’s problem is. I helped her a ton in this game. It’s weird to me that she has such a vendetta.[SEP]A:I guess it makes sense for her from a strategic standpoint to make me out to be a boogie man to get everyone headed this way.[SEP]B:Well I did expose some of your double-dealing to her, which might have helped. But yeah, agreed that it&amp;#39;s in her interest to get everyone against you, and then stab me when convenient.[SEP]A:Sent to Germany, England, Austria, Russia: So, England, Germany, Russia, y’all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would “teach him” and help his along to second place. Then y’all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)[SEP]A:(Part 2) At this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I’m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for “Hey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,” but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that’s really my preference. I am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo. And I’m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I’m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany’s favor. I propose that we draw and hug it out.🤗[SEP]B:Reply all to Italy&amp;#39;s message: First, if you didn&amp;#39;t get a message from Italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I&amp;#39;m down for the draw that he has proposed. I&amp;#39;d also like to add that I&amp;#39;ll be checking the &amp;#34;Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders&amp;#34; box. If everyone does this maybe we don&amp;#39;t have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I&amp;#39;m not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I&amp;#39;m exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.[SEP]A:Zzzzzzzzzzz[SEP]B:Any idea who didn’t want to draw?[SEP]A:I have a guess, but no idea. I have heard from nobody.[SEP]B:Huh. I was thinking it’s possible the game was set up in some way to not respect the draw order? I don’t know that much about the site and how the admin chose to configure the game[SEP]A:Oh, that could be. Maybe it has to run to 1910?[SEP]B:It’s not you, is it?[SEP]B:I feel like it&amp;#39;s gotta be you holding out on the draw. Well, good luck getting to 18 by the end of next year.[SEP]B:Hey. Good game. I think folks are pretty much done. I know i’m ready to move on. The draw proposal combined with the impending end of the game was effective in making us slack on our moves a bit (e.g., russia skipped a build this year). I don’t know that i can say whether you have a clear path to a solo if we were to continue. I know germany and I could at least get MAO next year, which would put pressure on Por and Spa. I think we’d all appreciate a draw though. Otherwise it will be “italy kind of won but kind of didn’t because the game got cut short”. Up to you though.[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;5th row&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;white-space:pre white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;[CLS]B:Hello Italy what’s up what are your thoughts on austria and France?[SEP]A:Hi Turkey! I’m sorry that I’ve been so slow to get in touch. Kind of a rough day for me to begin a game as I e been pretty swamped. Things are clearing up now, and I appreciate you reaching out to me. So far I have notes from Austria and Russia being pretty cagey and non-committal. Perhaps that is just the life of Italy? Nobody really has me in their plans? I don’t really know what I’m going to do yet, so if you have ideas, or you have a use for me, please let me know. I’d basically be delighted to work with anyone who really wants to work with me. (No sign yet that this includes anyone at all)[SEP]A:Hey Turkey — any interest in working together? I’m trying to think of ideas, but I’d just like to know first if you have interest, and then we can work out a plan if you do.[SEP]A:Any thoughts, Turkey?[SEP]B:Sure we can work together austria would be the most likely candidate for us to maul[SEP]A:Well, here is a thought: any chance you would support my army to Greece? If you’d like to work together against Austria, I think a great move would be to ask Austria to support you to Rum, and then support my army to Greece instead. If you are game to do that, I’d be happy to take down Austria with you and work with you moving forward. Thoughts?[SEP]B:I will support you to Greece 🇬🇷[SEP]B:I see what you are saying about rum I’m just not sure about lying in a game about lying or not[SEP]B:Let me think on it but yes to get that to work he has to not support to Greece 🇬🇷[SEP]A:I think we can lull him into a sense of calm. I really do. And I think that he will tell one of us the truth, so if you propose it, he will mention it to me and we will know whether he is being honest.[SEP]B:He said yes very quickly ...[SEP]A:Hi Turkey — just FYI, I think I’m better off just grabbing the easy build in Tunis this turn, so no need to support me to Greece just yet. Perhaps we can move on Austria next year?[SEP]A:I hope you’ve had a great weekend. Just so you know, I’m secretly hoping you build A Smyrna, F Constantinople. 🤞 🤞[SEP]A:I certainly like that build. Thoughts on how we can work together here?[SEP]B:Hmm I think austria is moving to Tyrol and coming after you[SEP]B:Not sure but he’s got a lot of units and he does lie[SEP]A:Hi Turkey, I am facing a critical decision point here. I’d really like to make a deal with you. I’ve just learned that Austria/Russia have a deal in place to attack you. Austria has promised Russia Bulgaria in exchange for Russia’s help against you. It’s pretty clear to me that I am Austria’s second choice for an ally, and I don’t want to help A/R take you down just to be their next snack.[SEP]A:The current A/R plan is for Austria to double support Russia to Bulgaria. Moscow is headed up to STP with Sev supporting UKR to BUL. I am supposed to make a surprise move towards France. A/R expects you to cover Smyrna and does not expect you to attack Sev given all the units surrounding you.[SEP]A:We have a terrific counter, if you’d like to work with me. I can tap Greece and Aegean, which should allow you to save Bulgaria (Const S Bulgaria holding). At the same time, Black Sea Support Armenia to Sevastopol WILL WORK! I’m planning to move over to Trieste, so the end result of all this would be Turkey regaining Sev and remaining at 5 while I take Trieste and get to 5. From there, I think we should be able to work together to finish off Austria.[SEP]A:I know that’s a lot to take in. I’m sorry to kind of dump all of this on you, but I just learned basically that Austria is prioritizing Russia’s growth over mine, and I can see the writing on the wall. I’d very much like to turn the tables on him. Can we do this?[SEP]A:Come talk with me!!![SEP]A:I’m still hoping to work this out with you. Please drop me a line when you have a free moment.[SEP]A:Hey man, I’m hoping that you’re still there and that you got my messages. I’d really like to speak with you.[SEP]A:I’m getting the impression that you just want to fight with me, and you don’t care what I have to say. If that’s the case, fine. But I do believe there is room for us to work together, so if you’d like to discuss that, drop me a line.[SEP]B:So turns out if you don’t say truth or lie it doesn’t send mail ...[SEP]A:Ha! Yeah, I’ve had that problem too![SEP]A:So, is it worth us having a discussion this turn? I sincerely wanted to work something out with you last turn, but I took silence to be an ominous sign.[SEP]B:I wasn’t silent[SEP]B:I just didn’t realize no emails went through[SEP]A:Tough break friend.[SEP]B:No worries it’s diplomacy[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div role=tabpanel class=&quot;tab-pane col-sm-12&quot; id=7741440640821113135bottom-7741440640821113135word&gt;&lt;div class=col-sm-6&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;freq table table-hover table-striped table-0&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Value&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Count&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Frequency (%)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;td title=to&gt; to &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;28342&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:5.5%&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 4.2% &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;td title=the&gt; the &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20569&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:4.0%&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 3.1% &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;td title=you&gt; you &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20107&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:3.9%&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 3.0% &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;td title=i&gt; i &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;18797&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:3.6%&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 2.8% &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;td title=a&gt; a &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14053&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:2.7%&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 2.1% &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;td title=and&gt; and &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12593&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:2.4%&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 1.9% &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;td title=of&gt; of &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9390&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:1.8%&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 1.4% &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;td title=that&gt; that &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9352&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:1.8%&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 1.4% &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;td title=in&gt; in &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9239&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:1.8%&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 1.4% &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;td title=is&gt; is &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8387&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:1.6%&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 1.3% &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=other&gt;&lt;td title=&quot;Other values (42194)&quot;&gt; Other values (42194) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;518192&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:100.0%&gt; 77.5% &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=col-sm-6&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE svg class=&quot;img-responsive center-img&quot;PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN&quot;\n",

I have a somewhat crazy idea that I’ve always wanted to try with I/G, but I’ve never actually convinced the other guy to try it. And, what’s worse, it might make you suspicious of me. \\n\\nSo...do I suggest it?\\n\\nI’m thinking that this is a low stakes game, not a tournament or anything, and an interesting and unusual move set might make it more fun? That’s my hope anyway.\\n\\nWhat is your appetite like for unusual and crazy?[SEP]B:You&#x27;ve whet my appetite, Italy. What&#x27;s the suggestion?[SEP]A:👍[SEP]B:It seems like there are a lot of ways that could go wrong...I don&#x27;t see why France would see you approaching/taking Munich--while I do nothing about it--and not immediately feel skittish[SEP]A:Yeah, I can’t say I’ve tried it and it works, cause I’ve never tried it or seen it. But how I think it would work is (a) my Spring move looks like an attack on Austria, so it would not be surprising if you did not cover Munich. Then (b) you build two armies, which looks like we’re really at war and you’re going to eject me. Then we launch the attack in Spring. So there is really no part of this that would raise alarm bells with France.\\n\\nAll that said, I’ve literally never done it before, and it does involve risk for you, so I’m not offended or concerned if it’s just not for you. I’m happy to play more conventionally too. Up to you.[SEP]A:I am just sensing that you don’t like this idea, so shall we talk about something else? That was just a crazy idea I’ve always wanted to try. I’m happy to play more conservatively.[SEP]A:Any thoughts?[SEP]B:Sorry Italy I&#x27;ve been away doing, um, German things. Brewing Lagers?[SEP]B:I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready to go for that idea, however I&#x27;d be down for some good ol&#x27;-fashioned Austria-kicking?[SEP]A:I am pretty conflicted about whether to guess that you were telling the truth or lying about the “brewing lagers” thing. I am going to take it literally and say 👎 even though I don’t think you meant it deceptively. 😉[SEP]A:But I think I can get over “Lagergate” and we can still be friends. \\n\\nAs of right now, I think Austria may be my most reliable ally. I’m thinking I’d like to play as a Central Trio if you have any interest in that. Thoughts?[SEP]B:We haven&#x27;t even passed a season yet and you have a &#x27;most reliable ally&#x27;?\\n\\nI&#x27;ll consider this proposal but, basically, I&#x27;m not going to expose myself to risk from either of you until I&#x27;ve seen a bit of your behavior[SEP]A:Well, at least I have an idea of who to trust. Obviously, my ideas are subject to change. \\n\\nI understand your desire to watch behavior before committing to anything. I, personally, am a partner player. I look carefully early in the game for a small group to work with, and then I value loyalty and collaboration. I like to work closely with a tight-knit alliance. \\n\\nIf you prefer to hop and back and forth, or play more of an individual game, then we might not be a good match. \\n\\nI’m looking for a loyal ally or two that I can coordinate with and make awesome moves with. Makes the game easier and a lot more fun.[SEP]A:Just an FYI: I’ve now had both England and France suggest to me that I should move to Tyrolia and France will support me to Munich in the Fall. One saying that to me is not a big deal, but with both mentioning it, my alarm bells are going off. I am concerned about an E/F. \\n\\nI’m certainly not moving to Tyrolia. But I just want you to be cautious here. I feel like England and France are working together.[SEP]B:I appreciate the tip, but I&#x27;m wondering why you&#x27;re so against ousting me from Munich if I haven&#x27;t explicitly agreed to be your ally?[SEP]A:Because it is terrible, terrible play for Italy to attack Germany, in my view. If I were to attack you in Munich, I could never hold Munich. So, all I would be doing is weakening you, and helping France, England, or both to get really big. \\n\\nI don’t have any long-term path going north. Helping France to take you down is a sucker’s play, whether you are working with me or not.[SEP]A:Did France tell you he was moving to Burgundy, or was that a stab?[SEP]B:I was not informed of it, no. And England is leading me to believe it&#x27;s part of a play for Belgium, so if they&#x27;re working together this might be a trick...\\n\\nItaly, you seem like a straight shooter, and Austria has confirmed with me about your two&#x27;s alliance. So I&#x27;ll confide in you--this is my first ever game of diplomacy, and I think that teaming up with the two of you could help me learn more and have more fun. So, if you&#x27;re still interested in a central powers alliance, I&#x27;m in.[SEP]B:Okay full disclosure: I&#x27;m not very smart, and I accidentally let slip to England that you told me France was plotting to take Munich. I&#x27;m sorry for the error but I figured it was better to admit it so you know that England/France may not trust you.[SEP]A:Okay, thanks for telling me.[SEP]B:So, um, no alliance then?[SEP]A:I do want to be allies. Sorry, busy weekend here running around with bambinos. More to come.[SEP]B:What would you think of helping me take Marseilles in two turns?[SEP]A:Hi Germany, I’ll certainly consider that. Though, I’ll note: traditionally, Germany would help Italy to Marseilles if the two of them work together there. The reason is that: if I help you to Marseilles, I’m basically cut off from going west and getting anything myself. So, usually, Germany would help Italy into Marseilles to encourage Italy to come west and Germany would plan to take Paris, Belgium and Brest.[SEP]B:Fair enough--I&#x27;ll help you take it, then, but I&#x27;ll need to deal with Belgium first.[SEP]A:How are things going with England? I think that getting him to work with you is the main key here.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m trying--I just offered to assist with taking Sweden in exchange for some assistance into Belgium...not sure if they&#x27;ll go for it...[SEP]A:I’ll check with England and try to see where his head is at.[SEP]B:I&#x27;ve actually been thinking about this game all day 😅 and have come up with a plan I like a bit better... but England still hasn&#x27;t responded to my initial offer.[SEP]A:That’s the worst!\\n\\nAnd I’m glad to see you’re so focused on this in your first game. It’s a really great game if you put in the time and effort![SEP]B:You&#x27;re definitely telling the truth on that one. So can I count on you to move to piedmont this season?[SEP]A:I don’t think I can afford to move to Piedmont this season. I don’t really trust Austria to avoid walking through that door if I leave it wide open. \\n\\nI think you need to get England on board to attack France.[SEP]B:That&#x27;s valid. And actually I was conferring with England and we concluded that it&#x27;s not really gonna be possible for me to help you take Marseilles this year anyway. \\n\\n...what are you and Austria planning for this year, then? I&#x27;m willing to tell you my plans in exchange as a gesture of trust. \\n\\nHave you communicated at all with England or France?[SEP]A:Hi, are you there?\\n\\nJust woke up. \\n\\nEngland did return my message, but he did not tell me anything substantive so I really don’t know what he’s doing. I’m planning to move towards Turkey.[SEP]A:Well, you’re in trouble. That England move is trouble. \\n\\nI’m going to try to convince him to change course. I suggest you be very kind to him, and don’t burn that bridge. I think your game hinges on turning England around.[SEP]A:Hi Germany,\\n\\nI’m working hard on turning England. And I’m also trying to get Russia to come to your aid. Doing the best I can! I’ll keep you posted.[SEP]B:England just told me that Russia is helping them to take Denmark so that may be a lost cause. Granted, the source for that intel is a serpentine jackal-spawn[SEP]A:Okay, I’m reasonably sure that England wants to take the Channel and attack France now. \\n\\nI believe that you should basically do whatever England asks to help make this happen. As long as E attacks F, you will be in a much better position, and you’ll gain back centers quickly. \\n\\nWhat are you hearing?[SEP]B:What are your plans for this turn? I can&#x27;t help but notice that Munich is surrounded by foreign armies on three sides...\\n\\nI wish I could be more helpful but I&#x27;m pretty much just treading water right now trying not to lose anything else[SEP]A:Hey — sorry, just getting back into this now.[SEP]A:I have good news! (1) I am finally attacking France this turn. (2) I will be supporting Munich to hold from Tyrolia. \\n\\nLet’s turn this game around, yes?[SEP]A:I am pretty sure that England is not attacking you this turn. And I am committed to supporting Munich holding. Make sure you don’t move Munich so that it can take my support.[SEP]B:Okay, can do. Thanks![SEP]A:I suggest that you order:\\nKiel Support Berlin holding\\nBerlin Support Munich holding\\nHelg to Holland\\nMunich Support Berlin holding[SEP]B:I agree completely--although I didn&#x27;t know that a country could hold *and* support at the same time! Thanks![SEP]B:Thanks Italy. Hope you&#x27;re enjoying the weather on the Anatolian 😉[SEP]A:I will be supporting Munich to hold again. And I’ll be trying to get Russia to back off your flank and protect himself against an Austrian stab that is coming.[SEP]A:Two bits of advice: #1 I suggest you tell Russia that Austria is coming for him. You really want Russia to move Sil back to Gal. You might also suggest to Russia that is he supports you to Denmark, you will then support Russia back to Sweden. I don’t know yet if it actually makes sense to do that, but you want Russia thinking that you are eager to work with him. He’ll be hoping for a reason to break off his attack on you at this point.[SEP]A:#2 Here is the move set I would suggest right now:\\nKiel Support Holland holding\\nHolland Support Wales to Belgium (tell England you are going to order this support and he can take it or leave it)\\nMunich Support Berlin holding\\nBerlin Support Munich holding\\n\\nI think that both France and Russia are about to back off you, as they are both under fire at home. Just hold still, and soon you should be able to break out of this holding pattern.[SEP]B:God, I hope so! I&#x27;m attempting to make that deal with russia now...and I&#x27;m talking with England re: Belgium[SEP]A:It’s none of my business, but if you do plan to take Denmark, I strongly recommend you wait until Fall. I think the most important thing for you right now is getting England fully committed against France. If that happens, taking Denmark later will be easy.[SEP]B:I think me and England are really on the same page at this point regarding France. I&#x27;m actually sort of running counter-intelligence for England (and my friends to the south, of course!) with Russia right now. \\n\\nEngland and I talked about Denmark too...and it seems like one or the other of Denmark or Belgium should work out for me this year and I&#x27;m fine with that[SEP]A:Great to hear. Thank you.[SEP]B:Do you need me to disrupt Bur this year? I&#x27;ll need to seriously trust Russia if I&#x27;m going to risk not holding my eastern front, I think...[SEP]A:I do think a move to Burgundy makes sense for you this turn, and I can’t imagine Russia attacking you here. He has a serious Austria problem. \\n\\nI suggest this:\\nMun - Bur\\nRuh - Bel\\nHol Support Ruh - Bel \\nBer - Kie\\n\\nTell Russia that the last thing in the world you want to see is Austria run him over, and you’re willing to help keep Russia viable if necessary (you’re angling for Russia to disband his northern holdings this turn).[SEP]A:And ask England nicely to support Ruh - Hol, with the explanation that you don’t plan to ask for Denmark back, but you think it would help you both to diminish France. (You’ll get Den back eventually, but you want England to think you don’t care about it).[SEP]B:Thanks, I&#x27;ll work on these. \\n...Why didn&#x27;t you scooch into the Aegean behind Austria? You could have defended or even held Bulgaria this turn?[SEP]B:England and I were talking about your moves for this season--what do you think of convoying Pie into Spa, supporting this with Wes, and then moving Tyr into Pie?[SEP]B:This leaves Marseilles open for Bur to fall into if France goes that route, which gives me an opening into Bur[SEP]A:That’s not bad.[SEP]A:I was kind of thinking I should pick one or the other of Marseilles or Spain to attack and not tell a soul which one I’m going after.[SEP]A:Do you really think it’s important to coordinate?[SEP]A:I do think you’re best off moving to Burgundy. And there is some chance that we fail this turn. But I think we just take a guess and hope for the best. We’ll get him next turn if not this one.[SEP]B:Okay—sorry for being nosy! I will try for bur on the off chance it shakes out that way[SEP]A:Nah, you’re not being nosy at all. I mean, come on, we both know that I have no problem sticking my nose where it doesn’t belong.[SEP]B:Marked as true[SEP]A:I like to coordinate, but on these sort of 50/50 guesses, I kind of like to keep it secret so that if it doesn’t go well, I have nobody to blame but myself.[SEP]A:Ha![SEP]B:Well, are you willing to humor my question about the Aegean, anyway?[SEP]A:Sure. I was thinking of moving that fleet to Ionian. You think a move to Aegean is better? I’m not really sure, but let’s talk it through.[SEP]B:No sorry I meant in hindsight--like this past turn you should have moved to Aeg so that this current turn, when Austria takes Rumania (from Bulgaria), you&#x27;d be there to cover Bulgaria so it couldn&#x27;t get scooped by the Black sea, and potentially you&#x27;d just get to take it.[SEP]A:Not a bad point. I agree.[SEP]A:Hmmmm, kind of a pointless lie if you ask me, but I won’t hold it against you. You’re in a tough spot.[SEP]B:um what lie? I did exactly the moves you suggested![SEP]A:Ha! So sorry!! I meant that for France![SEP]A:You are my favorite.[SEP]B:Marked as lie because clearly austria is your favorite.\\nSpeaking of, I assume that your seizing Trieste was mutually agreed upon?[SEP]A:Yes — agreed upon.[SEP]B:That&#x27;s not what Austria said to England...[SEP]A:Hmmmm, okay. Well, let’s just keep that between you and me then. 🤦‍♂️[SEP]B:You know italy, I think we *do* need to coordinate your move this time--England and I have a shot at either Bur or Mao if one of Marseilles or Spain can be left open for France to fall into. This will improve all of our chances of crushing France quickly.[SEP]A:Okay, I can dig it. What do you want me to do?[SEP]B:Let me confer with England and get back to you. Glad to hear that though![SEP]A:So...any thoughts on how to approach this?[SEP]B:It looks like England&#x27;s not willing to try for MAO if it means possibly losing the channel. However, they&#x27;ll bring the NWG fleet around to try for MAO next year. \\nSo if you could keep Marseilles open, it will help me to try and take Burgundy this turn.[SEP]A:If I leave Marseilles open, would you kindly use Burgundy in the Fall to help me take Marseilles? (Likely that means ordering Burgundy to Gascony to cut support)[SEP]B:Will do.[SEP]B:Okay, so I still have a teensy little bone to pick with you: on the off-chance that Austria wasn&#x27;t lying and you *did* take Trieste unexpectedly, I sort of worry that I might be next. Are you willing to tell me what your plans are for the Tri unit, or at least to warn me before any move into Tyrolia?[SEP]A:Sure. But, you’ll see from my moves this turn that Austria is lying to you.[SEP]A:I currently have Tri - Tyrolia. I like the unit there because it sets up an attack on Austria if I ever want to go that route (build A Ven and go east). Do you want me to keep Tyrolia clear?[SEP]A:I’ll add — I would never attack Germany as Italy. Setting myself as a giant column like that is just not defensible. It would be a terrible move.[SEP]B:Not when that column is not-so-giant and in a turf war with France.[SEP]B:oh you mean setting *yourself*[SEP]B:But you could easily pick off, say, Munich and not be a &quot;giant column&quot;[SEP]A:I mean this sincerely: any Germany who does that is a terrible player. \\n\\nWhy would I do that? I would need 2-3 units to hold one center. That is a net negative. And all of your units are doing things that are good for me in containing your neighbors. \\n\\nI’ve been working hard in this game for you to succeed and knock back France and England. I can say with 100% certainty: I’m not going to attack you. I’m going to keep helping you as much as I can.[SEP]A:That said, if you want me NOT to move to Tyrolia, I won’t move there.[SEP]B:Nah, I just needed some reassurance :)\\nYour logic is undenyable— enjoy your stay in tyr![SEP]B:*undeniable? That looks better[SEP]A:I mean it sincerely. I think that England will want to coax me to attack you with him after France falls, but I’d much rather work with you against England. \\n\\nBut first thing’s first — let’s get rid of France.[SEP]B:Agreed[SEP]B:(On the france part)[SEP]B:Sorry I won&#x27;t be able to cut off Gascony this turn...I probably should have just told you my moves; you could have advised me that supporting Mun-Bur was more important than Kie-Ruh[SEP]A:No worries. We’ll crack this but eventually. \\n\\nHere is my suggestion for this turn:\\nKie - Den\\nHol S Bel holding\\nBel S Ruh - Bur\\nMun S Ruh - Bur\\nRuh - Bur[SEP]A:I think you should suggest to England that he gets Sweden and St Petersburg, while you get Denmark back. That’s only fair, as you have been a loyal ally in the fight against France and you plan to continue to do that.[SEP]B:The moves I had already planned differ in one respect: I thought it would be worth the risk to try moving Hol-Bel and therefore move Bel-Bur. Even if me and France are high-fiving in Bel for a few seasons it&#x27;s still mine, and it&#x27;s not like Holland has anything better to do while I&#x27;m still allies with England.\\n\\n...The only reason I&#x27;m reluctant to make that agreement with England is that---while I think *you* and I have a good relationship---I really have not talked with Austria much at all, and I&#x27;m the next logical target for them when Russia&#x27;s gone. And anything that&#x27;s bad for Russia right now is good for Austria.[SEP]A:Hmmmm, I’m just not sure you should trust England enough right now to leave Holland open and Belgium essentially unguarded. \\n\\nFrance is a really good player, and he is no doubt working hard to get England to turn on you. My personal take is that you are better off being a bit more conservative until you have Denmark back and England has moved another fleet towards France. But I can see it either way.[SEP]A:With regard to Russia, talk it through with England. What you don’t want is England taking out Russia and giving you nothing. So, if England agrees to let Russia be for a while, then your plan sounds good. But if England is going to take Sweden, you really should get Denmark back. (I’m my view)[SEP]B:Okay you&#x27;ve convinced me: it&#x27;s worth figuring out what E&#x27;s plans are for Russia at least.\\n\\nAnd you&#x27;re almost certainly right, from a rational perspective, about leaving Holland/Belgium vulnerable to England. But I think England really is counting on my assistance in taking France, and because of that and other non-quantifiable reasons I trust them.[SEP]A:Excellent. Obviously you have a much better feel for your relationship with England than I do. Just know that France is persuasive, and I’m sure that’s what he’s working on. He stopped talking to me, so I bet he’s trying to turn England. Just keep reassuring England that you want to work with him long-term so he doesn’t succumb to the Dark Side.[SEP]A:Hi Germany — well, I think we’re getting to a critical point in the game here. France held out a long time, but he’s much less of a threat now. I think the critical issue, for you, is England. \\n\\nI have some thoughts on the matter, and some information, but I’d like to feel confident that you and I will keep anything we say between us. I think of you as the one person who has been honest with me on every turn. You even tell me the truth when it’s bad news, or when you don’t completely trust me, and I like that.[SEP]B:Okay, Italy. I won&#x27;t share any of this conversation. But in the interest of continued full disclosure, here&#x27;s what I think: England is a greater threat to *me* on the map, but *you* have a greater chance of soloing this game quickly, or pair-winning with Austria even sooner. And if I continue to collaborate with England, we at least have a chance of slowing that down. So I&#x27;m in sort of a conflicted spot[SEP]A:This is why I like you. The full disclosure part. You tell me the truth even when the news isn’t great.[SEP]A:My thoughts on the “Germany/England forever so that at least we can stop the solo” strategy: (1) It’s quite early to be talking about solos. I am at 8, and Austria could take 3 from me any time, quite easily. (2) I don’t think England is thinking that way. I think he’s thinking that a dominant power will emerge in the north, and one will emerge in the south. And he’s like to be that dominant power.[SEP]A:England’s pieces are not positioned well if he’s trying to attack France or contain Italy. He keeps Denmark guarded, and North Sea filled. He is not playing like he intends to stick with you, even though I’m sure he’s telling you that.[SEP]A:You’re right that you don’t want to start a war with England right now. But, you must stick up for yourself, because nobody else will do that if you don’t.[SEP]A:If I were you, this is what I would do: (1) keep warning England about the dangers of Italy getting too big and insist that England moves his fleets towards MAO (Channel to Irish, Norwegian to NAO, North - Channel), (2) insist on taking Denmark back.[SEP]A:I would say something like this:\\n\\nEngland, I’m with you my friend, but we’re passed the stage of you needing to keep me under lock and key. I need to take Denmark back. I’m happy to support you to Brest to keep you growing, or you can grab Sweden. You have plenty of options other than keeping your ally’s center, but if you really want to be my ally long-term, you’ve got to show me that.[SEP]A:I am hearing from England signs that he may be thinking of attacking you soon. And I think you actually avoid that better by being strong and sticking up for yourself rather than being accommodating and letting him do whatever he wants to do.[SEP]B:Well, both you and France have now pointed out that England is strategically not in a good place to be my ally right now, and you are correct. I&#x27;ll be more cautious with my northern border, but I made a pretty strong argument for denmark this past turn and it fell on deaf ears[SEP]B:...which probably also should have been a sign for me[SEP]A:Well, if you want, you could just take Denmark this next year and I don’t think England is in a position to retaliate.[SEP]B:Probably not...has France been talking with you at all about their sunsetting strategy? They&#x27;ve indicated a willingness to work with you and me and a desire to see England get as few dots as possible[SEP]A:He did say that to me too. Though, France has a long history of lying to me, so I really don’t trust him.[SEP]B:Well France has actually been pretty honest with me, and I at least am certain that they wouldn&#x27;t betray me to England. So, I&#x27;m considering working with F to sabotage (or potentially full-on backstab) England this turn, which would have the side-effect of maybe taking some attention away from the south for you anyway.[SEP]B:(and I&#x27;d be interested to hear your thoughts on this if you&#x27;re in the mood to give out free advice)[SEP]A:Hi Germany — sorry for the delay. Well...I think it’s really important that you get a build this turn either way. I don’t think England will get a build this turn, so if I were you I’d probably take Paris, build a fleet, and move on England after that.[SEP]A:But it likely depends on how communication is going with England. If he’ll give you back Denmark, that might change the equation.[SEP]B:I am waiting on England to make a decision about that--they claim to be thinking about it.[SEP]B:England told me you said I was plotting with France. It makes sense you’d want to pit us against each other.[SEP]A:Hey — tried to send you a message earlier but not was down. England was telling me that you’re saying that I told you that England is plotting against you. The problem with telling England that is that he will stop giving me useful info.[SEP]A:Truly, I don’t want you and England to fight. I am not trying to break you up. I suggested that you take Paris! I want you guys to work together with me against France.[SEP]B:You don&#x27;t want us to fight, yet you betrayed both of our confidence with you in a way that makes us distrust each other?[SEP]A:I really don’t think that’s a fair description. You guys both wanted to attack each other. I encouraged you both to keep working together.[SEP]B:Just as long as it suits you. Are you going to give England Mao?[SEP]A:Hmmm, should I be reading that as angry sarcastic with dagger eyes? (I’m not sure if I’m getting your tone right)[SEP]A:We’re friends, right? I believe that every single message I’ve sent you all game has been truth, and I’ve gone out of my way to give you candid advice. Are we still friends?[SEP]A:Regarding MAO — I don’t know. What do you want me to do? I don’t have any set plan.[SEP]B:Yep, there&#x27;s some sarcasm there. Looking back at your messages, I still don&#x27;t read them as encouraging collaboration. And if you wanted us to be friends, you could have done that without betraying me to England by simply saying in your candid way &quot;I don&#x27;t think you should do that for such and such reason&quot;. But you chose to increase E&#x27;s distrust of me. So I think you might be full of gnocchi and crap. \\n\\nMy trust in you is a bit shaken but I still think we can have a working partnership with a bit more caution on my end. It would be my preference that you hold Mao, on the assumption that if it came down to a choice between partnering with me or England, you&#x27;d choose me. If that&#x27;s not the case, then as the filling of an England-Italy sandwich I&#x27;m in no position to retaliate anyway.[SEP]A:Well, again, I like that you’re honest with me, even when the news is bad.[SEP]A:I have to say that I’m surprised that you feel that I’ve betrayed your trust. I have been feeling like maybe I’ve been TOO helpful to you, and been a bit over the top in offering advice, etc., but it seems like I’ve misread the situation.[SEP]B:No, it&#x27;s completely true that you&#x27;ve been too helpful, and I&#x27;m really really grateful for it because I&#x27;ve been able to learn so much from this game. But it&#x27;s also true that you didn&#x27;t have to tell England what you did, and all you stood to gain from it was that it shook my and E&#x27;s trust in each other.[SEP]A:But I understand what you’re saying, and I much prefer to have a heart to heart like this, a frank airing of grievances, rather than being surprised by unkind moves on the board. https://youtu.be/xoirV6BbjOg[SEP]B:Was not expecting seinfeld today and it was a pleasant surprise[SEP]A:🤗[SEP]A:Here’s the deal: I like you better than England.[SEP]A:I’m not sure how the next couple of turns are going to shake out. But I like that you tell me when you’re angry with me. I know that may seem like a small thing, but it’s just rare in Diplomacy. You get so many fake smiles.[SEP]A:So, if it comes down to you or him, I’m choosing you. And I’ll work to do a better job of keeping your confidence. I certainly understand how important that is, as I hate it when people o that same thing to me.[SEP]A:So no more playing mediator for me.[SEP]B:Okay. Is it true that you want the channel?[SEP]B:And are you planning to keep Vienna?[SEP]A:I am not planning to keep Vienna. And yeah I’ve asked France for support to the Channel. Do you think he’s on board?[SEP]B:I&#x27;m not sure. Is *England* on board? Is this something England can know about?[SEP]A:No, do you think France will Support me to the Channel?[SEP]B:France has asked my opinion on it, and I haven&#x27;t given it yet. To my estimation things look a lot better for me if you don&#x27;t end up there: I don&#x27;t want to see England in Mao, and I don&#x27;t want to see you snagging pieces of the north.[SEP]A:Okay, well, here is my thinking. Tell France whatever you want to make him happy. Then tell me how you really feel. And if you don’t want me to go there, I won’t go there.[SEP]B:If I hadn&#x27;t asked you about it, would that have just been another surprise, too?[SEP]A:Absolutely. \\n\\nYou and I have discussed our moves and been honest with each other every turn. But we have not been sharing all our moves or pre-clearing all of our moves. So that would have Ben a surprise in the same way that your moves are a surprise to me. (I never tell you what to do or insist on knowing).[SEP]A:I kind of thought that you would have wanted me in the Channel because it commits me further against England, but I can understand what you’re saying now about wanting me to hang back.[SEP]A:But I don’t think there is anything wrong with me contemplating moves without telling you all of them. You asked me about it, and I told you the truth.[SEP]B:I do think that this move is a breach of general expectation, which is the kind of thing I&#x27;d like to know about. And it&#x27;s also the kind of thing I&#x27;ve shared with you: case in point, my desire to stab England.[SEP]A:Okay. Understood.[SEP]B:Is there anything I could gain from seeing you in the channel? Would you support me taking Nth, and potentially seizing the island?[SEP]B:Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m thinking: I would be on board with you taking the channel (and I&#x27;d give France the green light to go ahead with it) if you would agree to bump Nao out of Mao using Wes, and if you&#x27;d be open to supporting some anti-English aggression while holding the channel so that I can get on equal footing with you, dot-wise.\\n\\nIf you don&#x27;t want to agree to those terms, that&#x27;s okay, but I would strongly prefer not to see you in the channel in that case.[SEP]A:I’m going to be out of pocket this weekend, so let’s talk this through more on Monday. Generally, I agree that I’ll either stay out of the Channel or agree to your terms for entering there.[SEP]B:If you decide to stay out of the channel, I have a deal that I like with England in the works. For that deal to go through, you&#x27;d have to agree to move Mao into Portugal to let England take Mao. Would you be amenable to that?[SEP]B:(If this second offer is more to think about than a no-brainer, you can just mull it over and let me know monday)[SEP]A:So, here is my concern with the England offer: If I’m taking Portugal, why do we want England in MAO? And why would he want to go to MAO? I’m not sure I understand that one. Can you explain?[SEP]B:Well, when I initially proposed the deal I had forgotten that Portugal was promised to England. Then England agreed to it on the condition that you would confirm that move, so I figured E thought you would just move out of there next year? But now that I think about it, it’s probably worth asking England why they’d agree to that.[SEP]A:I’d prefer that you not tell England I am considering moving to the Channel. I don’t think he would like that.[SEP]A:I don’t really want to discuss this stuff with England at all.[SEP]B:Well, England changed their mind about the plan I offered anyway. So, are you taking the channel?[SEP]A:No, I’m not taking the Channel.[SEP]B:Okay was that a recent decision? Because like an hour ago France said they were supporting you into the channel[SEP]A:Well, when I tell you what I plan to do, do you turn around and tell France? This makes me uncomfortable speaking with you.[SEP]B:I haven&#x27;t spoken to France since then. I didn&#x27;t realize you were giving the two of us different information on this particular subject. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve revealed anything to them about what you plan to do. Mostly because you haven&#x27;t told me.[SEP]A:Well, I have been honest with both you and France. You told me that I need to promise you a set of things in order to take the Channel. I felt like it was more than I could be sure of doing, so I am not entering the Channel. I won’t go there without your permission.[SEP]B:I appreciate that. And I&#x27;ll keep the remainder of this conversation between us unless I hear otherwise. Have you just recently made an agreement with England?[SEP]B:I heard as much but I want to verify the contents of that agreement with you[SEP]B:Btw, France just said that they submitted the orders to support you into the channel.[SEP]A:I don’t have an agreement with England, but he is asking me about my moves and trying to get my help.[SEP]B:Okay--then England is lying to me, saying that you&#x27;re helping support Eng-Brest.[SEP]A:Ha! Yeah, fat chance.[SEP]B:...but did you lie to England about that? Or can I say to England that I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll actually provide that support?[SEP]A:What is Paris up to?[SEP]A:I suggest you just not tell England anything about my moves.[SEP]A:Do you want me to support England to Brest?[SEP]A:I guess I’m not sure what your goals are here.[SEP]A:I just kind of feel like you’re grilling me with a lot of questions, but not telling me what you’re doing or what you want from me.[SEP]B:*If* you support Eng-Brest, England has agreed to vacate denmark for me. If you don&#x27;t, I won&#x27;t get in the way of your channel thing. Any other questions?[SEP]B:I have no sense of what you want or what your plan is, but I thought I&#x27;d been pretty clear: I want Denmark. I am reluctant to see you in the Channel if England remains powerful, but happy to see you there if they are weakened.[SEP]A:Can’t you just force Denmark?[SEP]B:Not without risking a swipe of Belgium[SEP]B:And why force when you don&#x27;t have to[SEP]A:Okay, I’ll support England to Brest. You take Denmark.[SEP]A:And you and I should be in position to take out England next year.[SEP]B:Splendid![SEP]B:Glad everything worked out 😃[SEP]A:👍[SEP]A:Congratulations on retaking Denmark and getting two builds. You are playing really well right now. Respect.[SEP]B:Congrats on having double-digit dots! I have some thoughts about taking out England, if you want to go full-stab this season...[SEP]A:I think I do! 🤫[SEP]A:What are you thinking?[SEP]B:One option is to take the channel, another is to take Brest. Between you, me, and Picardy we can manage either, but it&#x27;s a question of which takes priority. If we chose Brest, I could also take a stab at seizing Nth this season, then we could try for the channel in fall. Or we could do channel first, Brest second.[SEP]A:Yeah, that is all along the lines of what I’m thinking. How demanding does France sound right now? Does he want to be the one who takes Brest?[SEP]B:Haven&#x27;t asked. But in general not demanding.[SEP]A:Good!\\n\\nStill, I think we should show him some good faith by supporting him to Brest in Spring. We can decide in Fall whether it makes more sense for you to take it, but I think we want to keep France hungry.[SEP]A:I would suggest something like this to ensure the English fleet is disbanded:\\nPic - Bre\\nMAO - Channel\\nPar S Pic - Bre[SEP]A:And Spa - Gas to cut off that retreat.[SEP]A:You can take the North Sea on the same move and set up a convoy to the English mainland. \\n\\nCheckmate.[SEP]B:Okay, I like the plan! I&#x27;ve asked France if they&#x27;re willing to move to Brest supported by me.[SEP]B:Aren&#x27;t you concerned about England taking Mao? I&#x27;d sooner just have you pile on support into Bre so that Wes can support Mao holding[SEP]A:That’s a good point, but the problem with that approach is that Brest is not guaranteed. If England cute MAO and supports with the Channel, the attack fails. I think we are better off ensuring that the Brest fleet is disbanded. If we disband that fleet and take North Sea, an English fleet in MAO really just spreads him out and allows you to take the island faster. It’s not like he can get Portugal or Spain.[SEP]B:Okay, but that means I&#x27;d prefer to take Brest myself this Spring, if France is okay with it.[SEP]A:I think that we should offer France Brest in Spring. That ensures that he is with us. Then, if conditions are right in the Fall, I can support you into Brest. But...England can offer France Belgium, and I think he is sure to take that if we’re not even offering him a center, right?[SEP]A:Better to keep France feeling like we’re going to keep him in the game. If you need the build in Fall, it’s easy for me to support you there.[SEP]B:I guess I’m just wondering from France’s perspective why they’d *want* to stay in the game. Isn’t it possible they’d rather move on with their life? That’s not rhetorical, I’m wondering what your perspective is as a veteran player[SEP]A:Here is my take: If France just wanted to go down in a blaze of glory and say “eff you” to England, he would have kept Irish Sea. He kept Pic, which is next to his home center, and gives him a chance to negotiate with both you and England.[SEP]A:I think that means he is motivated to keep trying. And if he believes he can get Brest, he could legitimately get back to his feet. I know that’s what I’d be trying to do in his position.[SEP]A:As the poker saying goes: “a chip and a chair.” So long as you have one chip left, and you’re still in the tournament, you can always come back to win.[SEP]A:Thoughts?[SEP]B:I think that makes sense. Are you talking with England at all?[SEP]A:I’m pretty wary of England right now. He asked me what I want to do, but I feel like he’s trying to get me to leave MAO open. That’s not terrible news, as it suggests that he won’t expect your move to North Sea.[SEP]A:As long as he doesn’t move NAO to Norwegian, you’ve got a guaranteed supply center.[SEP]B:Well E&#x27;d have to be a right dolt not to retreat to NWG. And right now they&#x27;re talking to me about supporting a move from Bre to Gas (the better for the two of us to stab you).[SEP]B:What i mean is, there&#x27;s a good chance that Mao is safe if I &quot;agree&quot; to that deal[SEP]B:Oh nevermind--they&#x27;re not going to convoy into Brest. So actually this pretty much guarantees that Eng and Nao will try for Mao.[SEP]A:Ahhhh, sneaky Devil! Thank you for letting me know.[SEP]A:I still like our plan.[SEP]A:I need to run for a bit. I’ll be around in a few hours.[SEP]B:I think that knowing this, you should do as I suggest and not poke Eng. Just hold and let Wes support. I am 94% sure I can trust England to do as they say on this one.[SEP]A:Okay. Should I support Pic to Bre?[SEP]B:yes please. It&#x27;ll do us good with France too if we both support.[SEP]A:👍[SEP]B:Actually, you should use Mao to support Spa-Gas, since we know that Brest is moving there. It will be beneficial to have you there if we decide to oust France from Bre in fall[SEP]A:Consider it done.[SEP]A:Hmmmm, heading anything from England?[SEP]A:I’d love to talk if you’re there. I’m getting the impression that England may actually be moving on you, and I think I have a good counter, but I also still think we should support the attack on Brest and take North Sea.[SEP]A:I definitely think you should keep your moves the same.[SEP]A:Nice! Get’em! He WAS moving on you. But we should be able to take about 3 off of him now. Very nice turn.[SEP]B:Sorry; I was asleep by 9 last night 😂 \\n\\nwhy the move to Nao? Wouldn&#x27;t IRI be the more anti-England choice?\\n\\nWith the move to Picardy and assuming a retreat to SKA, it looks like England has me pretty powerless this turn.[SEP]B:So do you, it seems, if you have some kind of deal with Russia about Munich.[SEP]A:Good morning. \\n\\nJust responding to your messages above. I think NAO and Irish are equally anti-English. They both give me a clear lane to attack Liverpool. I wasn’t sure if either one would be left open, but I took a gamble and it paid off.[SEP]A:Re your move this turn, I don’t think you’re powerless. You should get a build I think and if not, you should be in position to smash England.[SEP]A:I don’t have a deal regarding Munich, Germany. Frankly, I thought you would be a bit more joyful towards me. By attacking England, I have committed completely to working as your partner.[SEP]B:I suppose you&#x27;re right. Initially I was thinking IRI also gives you channel access, but NWG access may be just as useful. \\n\\nWell when you control half a continent (and even more when you consider your influence over me, austria, and who knows who else!), there&#x27;s no such thing as complete commitment. I&#x27;m not so naive as to think your allegiance with me is going to last beyond its usefulness, and with two fleets on the British isle that time is fast approaching. To be clear, I&#x27;m still giving you the truth and I still want to work with you. But you should really stop acting surprised when I&#x27;m slightly paranoid that a soon-to-be-dozen-dot-holder is gearing up to stab me[SEP]A:Well, I dunno, it sounds like I should stab you. Is that what you’re trying to tell me?\\n\\nI like you. I like how hard you’ve worked in this game to rebound from a difficult start. I like that you e told me the truth, even when the news was bad. I like that you tell me when you don’t trust me. I have literally never told you a lie in this game, and I don’t intend to start now. Last turn I burned my bridge with England beyond repair. If you don’t want to work with me now, that’s really disappointing.[SEP]B:like I said, I *do* want to work with you. However, remember that thing I said about general expectations and being warned when they&#x27;re broken? Tyrolia is one of them and I think you knew that. And England *also* told me they&#x27;ve never told me a lie; I&#x27;m starting to think that&#x27;s Diplomacy-speak for &quot;when convenient, I&#x27;ve used careful wording and half-truths to deceive you even when everything I said was technically true&quot;. \\n\\nIt would help me to know that you see me being a benefit to you beyond taking out England. A natural next move for us would be to take out russia, and in that arena I have a positional advantage over you. Especially if I get two builds this turn, I&#x27;ll be able to sneak behind the troops in bohemia/galicia and help you break through.[SEP]A:Yes — here is how I expect and hope the game will play out: the two of us finish off England and France, while drifting towards the east a bit. With the builds we get this year, we essentially blitzkrieg the East. I have more units than you, but you have no opposition at all in the north, and can take Scandinavia, War and Mos without any trouble.[SEP]A:I think that, in about two years, you and I will both be on about 14 centers, with the remnants of Russia and Austria between us, and we can decide how we want to resolve it. I’d be happy to agree to a small draw, or to shoot for a 17-17 two-way draw position, whichever you prefer.[SEP]B:Well, I like the sound of all of that. In fact, it sounds ideal: there&#x27;s something poetic about the complete beginner and the expert (you&#x27;ve probably heard by now that you got doxxed) sharing a victory. \\n\\nI ask for a concession: As a show of good will, would you be willing to take only one of Liverpool or Portugal this year? (I know the Portugal request seems weird, but I like keeping France around and unless I&#x27;m mistaken they like me better than you 😃 )[SEP]A:Yes. I wasn’t planning to take Portugal anyway.[SEP]A:I think it makes sense here for you to land an army in the English island while you can. Now that his army is off the island, he’s toast as soon as you do that.[SEP]B:England&#x27;s just vindictive enough to try and stab Belgium with England and Picardy, though. I was planning on keeping holland around as support.[SEP]B:*by England I of course mean Eng[SEP]A:I suggest the following:\\n\\nGas - Liv (via convoy)\\nSpa S MAO holding\\nMar hold\\nTyr - Tri\\n\\nHol - Yor (via convoy)\\nBur S Bel\\nBel S North\\nHEL S North\\nMun - Boh\\nPar - Pic (to cut any potential support)[SEP]A:England cannot take Belgium with those moves.[SEP]A:Or I could move my fleet into Liverpool and use Gas to support Bre. I’m happy either way.[SEP]B:I tried a double convoy in the sandbox once and it didn&#x27;t work! What is this witchcraft?!?[SEP]B:At any rate, I prefer the fleet move to liverpool and Gascony&#x27;s support into Brest. And could Mao support Bre into the Channel? No sense forcing France to disband. Bel will support it, too.[SEP]A:Here are the orders needed to do a convoy!\\nHolland move to Yorkshire\\nNorth Sea convoy Holland to Yorkshire\\n\\nIt is not a “double convoy” as you only need one fleet to make it happen. \\n\\nBut if your fleet in North Sea is dislodged, the convoy will not go through. That is why I would suggest that HELG supports North Sea holding and Belgium supports North Sea holding.[SEP]B:No--I mean the one *you* were planning: Gascony to Liverpool[SEP]B:It&#x27;s a double convoy because you&#x27;re convoying through Mao *and* Nao[SEP]A:Ah, the orders there would be:\\nGascony - Liv\\nMAO Convoy Gas - Liv\\nNAO Convoy Gas - Liv[SEP]A:So, I’ll move the fleet to Liverpool. And you want MAO to support Paris to Brest?[SEP]A:Or wait, MAO supports Brest to Channel, and Gas supports Paris - Brest, right?[SEP]B:yeah. I tried that once in the sandbox (or the equivalent: back when you had fleets in Lyo and Wes I tried a convoy from Pie to Naf). But I think I messed up the commands to the fleets. \\n\\n And yes the most recent message is correct. Those two things and Nao-Lvp[SEP]A:Okay, confirmed. \\n\\nSo I’ve got in:\\nNAO - Liv\\nMAO S Bre - Channel\\nGas S Par - Bre\\nSpa - WES\\nMar S Gas holding \\nTyrolia - Trieste\\n\\nSound right?[SEP]B:It does. But If Tyr was bound for trieste anyway, why did you detour through Tyr at all? Why not just move to trieste last turn??[SEP]A:Austria would not have liked it.[SEP]A:And he doesn’t know that it’s headed back there now (please don’t tell)[SEP]B:Understood. Me and Austria don&#x27;t talk anyway. Also, do you have any sense of what England is planning to do?[SEP]A:Ha! No I don’t. I’d imagine he is coming for me. But I don’t know that.[SEP]A:If I were him, I’d defend Edi and London.[SEP]B:So you haven&#x27;t been talking to England at all? I was sort of hoping you would know more, maybe help us take better advantage of their plans.[SEP]B:Anyway, my moves are:\\n\\nPar-Bre\\nBel s Bre-Eng\\nHol s Bel holding\\n\\nAnd the rest within expected parameters. Correct?[SEP]A:England has not said anything of substance to me. He was gracious about my move, but he won’t trust me again, and I would not trust anything he might say at this point. I haven’t asked him about his moves and he hasn’t told me.[SEP]A:I thought you would Convoy Holland to Yorkshire and support Belgium from Burgundy. Also, can you please order Mun to Boh to cut support and allow me to hold Vienna while moving Tyrolia to Trieste?[SEP]B:I *told* you I&#x27;m not risking that convoy *and* that instead Bel is supporting France into the Channel (which will heretofore be called the French Channel). And could I persuade you to move to IRI instead of taking Liverpool in exchange for the requested cut?[SEP]A:Sorry, what is the requested cut? I understand that you don’t want me to take Liverpool or Portugal. What are you offering to me? (I don’t mean to be difficult, I just want to be sure I understand).[SEP]A:Ah, you must mean Munich to Boh.[SEP]A:Asking me to avoid taking Por and Liv is asking a lot. I want France to survive here, but I also want England taking units off the board, and I feel like you should too, right?[SEP]B:I do. But I also want those dots for myself, of course. And there&#x27;s still the nonzero chance that you&#x27;ve arranged with Boh to take Munich for yourself, so I&#x27;m taking a serious risk[SEP]A:I will avoid taking Portugal, vacate Tyrolia, and support you to Brest. I feel like I’m offering quite a lot in exchange for one cut support. \\n\\nAnd cutting that support does not put you in greater peril. If I had a deal with Russia for Munich (I don’t) I could cut Burgundy from Marseilles and support Russia to Munich. Moving Mun to Boh to cut support is costless.[SEP]B:You&#x27;re right. I just thought I&#x27;d put my best argument forward. I&#x27;ll do the cut. But I ask for something costless in exchange, and I really, really want it to stay just between us, ok?[SEP]A:Understood and agreed.[SEP]A:And I have no problem with you asking for more than you’re willing to settle for. That’s smart, and I do the same thing sometimes. If you don’t stick up for yourself, nobody else will.[SEP]B:I *know* there&#x27;s more to your relationship with England than you&#x27;re telling me. The last message England sent to me hinted that if *I* wasn&#x27;t willing to work with them--and I haven&#x27;t said anything to them since--that maybe *you* would. And if England were to reach out to you, you&#x27;re too smart to just snub them. There&#x27;s advantage to be gained--either for both of us or just for yourself--from talking to them. The only reason I stopped was because I knew my word would be mud to them anyway.\\n\\nEarlier I was hoping you&#x27;d give me the truth about what you knew, and about what they might know. But you didn&#x27;t and that both disappoints and scares me. So I&#x27;m asking that you give me just a modicum of honesty here: what do you know? what does England know?[SEP]A:I give you my word: I don’t know what England is going to do and I haven’t asked.[SEP]A:He is still jovial with me and respectful. He has asked me to critique his play and to give him advice. But I do not know his moves, and I really don’t think he would tell me them if I asked. It certainly would not be info I could trust free I just lied to him about mine.[SEP]B:But England&#x27;s desperate. Better to talk with *someone* than just go in blind. And I doubt they&#x27;d turn to Russia or France because neither is really close enough/powerful enough to give real help. And there&#x27;s precedent for you negotiating with someone even as you stab them: France.\\n\\n...and here&#x27;s the real accusation: for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me, you&#x27;ve been sneaky and you&#x27;ve always pitted me and England against each other to your benefit. My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking your advice, it would be so *easy* to just feed England enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island. \\n\\nI know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over. And I assume others are like me, hence I suspect you now. \\n\\nI&#x27;m offering this confession in hopes that you&#x27;ll do the same. So just come clean and let&#x27;s approach this thing as equals?[SEP]A:I am in my car, off to pick-up my kids from school. This deserves a proper response, so please give me some time.[SEP]B:Abandon the children this is important 😜[SEP]A:So, I’m going to speak frankly here. I am rarely offended in a Diplomacy game, and I rarely say so when I am, but this message offends me. I’m trying to think about why I’m having such a strong reaction to it. I think it’s because you’re painting a picture of the game (both your actions and mine) which are totally different than my own perspective. (Continuing)[SEP]A:From my perspective, you were on the ropes early. France and England were teaming up on you. You lost Denmark and France had Holland and Munich surrounded. You were in serious peril. \\n\\nI seriously went to extreme effort to keep you in the game. I spent hours talking with England and encouraging him to turn around and go the other way. I completely ended my eastern campaign and spent two seasons just making the voyage over to France so that he didn’t have the bandwidth to continue his attack. I have vouched for you with Austria and Russia many times. I have supported Munich. And I have NEVER attacked you, even when people have asked me to do so and pledged to support me.[SEP]A:I have been honest with you, I have worked hard for your success, and I’ve made a lot of proposals to you in which you gain centers; not me. \\n\\nMaybe I am just a bad ally, but I’m not sure I remember an alliance in which I have done more to help my ally. Truly.[SEP]A:And to hear that (1) You think I’ve been selfish and (2) You’ve been sabotaging me all along, that just doesn’t sit well with me.[SEP]A:I have rarely asked for your help, and I’ve offered my help freely. I’ve provided my sincere best efforts to help you with tactics, and I have never sabotaged you. Not once.[SEP]A:And if I’m totally honest with you, I could solo this game if I felt like lying to everyone and grabbing dots. I think I’ve got you all beat tactically. I just have more experience. But that’s not been my intent.[SEP]A:I’ve spent hours today talking with England about how best to play Diplomacy. I’ve tried to give him some honest advice because he asked for it. But I don’t know his moves, I haven’t asked for them, and I’m not going to take advantage of that relationship to try to stab you. It legitimately did not cross my mind until you accused me of doing it.[SEP]A:So, I’m frustrated by this accusation.[SEP]B:And I appreciate all you’ve done for me, really I do. But “completely ending your eastern campaign” is *not* something you did for me; your alliance with Austria dictated that. \\nI felt bad for betraying you while I was doing it, but even then I knew it was the only way to keep the game going in the face of your and Austria’s might. And it *wasn’t* “all along”, it was a few turns at best so that the rest of us would have a shot at you and Austria not pair-winning right out of the gate. And the only thing that keeps me from thinking you’re not gonna do just that on the next move anyway is my belief that you really do want the victory all to yourself, which is still consistent with everything you’ve done for me. Propping up a weak player at the expense of stronger ones is a classic tactic. (Continuing)[SEP]B:And so, by the way, is trying to shame someone for raising extremely legitimate concerns. Whenever I bring up suspicion of you, you’re quick to remind me how much you’ve done for me to put me on the defensive and make me feel indebted. Well frankly that reeks of dishonesty. I never asked you to do those things.[SEP]B:If you no longer trust me, so be it. I knew that was a risk when I made my confession. But i’d rather have a partnership based on mutual honesty. That’s another reason I confessed—you ought to know that my game philosophy (new as it is) is to trust the map and to trust history first and foremost. The parts of your history that I’ve seen indicate that you’re no saint, no matter what you may have done for me. And when the map shows that one player is clearly dominating and that player is you, you are being deeply naive if you think everyone else is just going to roll over and let you get away with it[SEP]A:No, all thumbs up from me. If I were lying to you, I’d smile and say “that sounds great.” I’m honest with you because I sincerely thought of us as partners.[SEP]B:Oh but you’re *not*! You agreed to warn me of unexpected moves, then didn’t. When I brought this up you ignored it and misdirected me in hopes I’d forget. You’ve revealed things to England without my permission, and then made up a story about it after the fact!\\n\\nAnd you can’t be a real partner with someone who is depending on your good graces to survive. That’s not a partnership. We could never be real partners unless we had some notion of equality, and I’m outmatched in both skill and numbers.\\n\\nYou and Austria, however, were until recently a perfect example of a true partnership. Dot-parity, coordinated attacks, really beautiful work. So don’t act as if you don’t know this to be true. We were never a partnership of that kind.[SEP]A:Well, this is very disappointing to me, and I obviously disagree with the way you are characterizing me and this game. \\n\\nI have a reputation in this hobby for being sincere. Not for being duplicitous. It has always served me well. \\n\\nIf you feel that way, then me continuing to explain myself isn’t going to change your mind. If you don’t want to work with me, then I can understand that. Let’s consider our deals and commitments to be void, and let’s play our games separately. \\n\\nIf you have any deal you’d like to propose, I’ll consider them, but I won’t continue to try to help your game if you think I’m not sincerely trying to be helpful.[SEP]A:Well, this game just got less fun.[SEP]B:for you, maybe.[SEP]A:Sent to Germany, England, Austria, Russia: So, England, Germany, Russia, y’all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would “teach him” and help his along to second place. Then y’all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)[SEP]A:(Part 2)\\nAt this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I’m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for “Hey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,” but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that’s really my preference. \\n\\nI am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo. And I’m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I’m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany’s favor. \\n\\nI propose that we draw and hug it out.🤗[SEP]B:I&#x27;m down for a five-way draw. \\n\\n...and by the way, England was copy-pasting to me the most incriminating messages you sent them. So I knew you were giving England my moves. I do have a certain begrudging respect for you ability to deny, though 😉[SEP]A:Well, England is telling me he is happy to see me solo and wants second place...so, should I say “no”? I guess I should have. I was happy the way the game was going before all that.[SEP]B:Don&#x27;t try and pin *your* greed and deceit on England! At least *own* it when you&#x27;re ruthless[SEP]A:You have been given an apple laced with poison. England’s only move there was to make you hate me, and he did his job well. \\n\\nYou should not let your view of me be defined by someone who has an incentive to make you never speak to me again. We can talk about it more after the game, but I had every intention of continuing to work with you, and I would have done that until England made his play.[SEP]B:I have no doubt you would have continued to work with me, but I take issue with someone who can be asked point-blank if they&#x27;re sharing moves with another player and lie to my face. If you&#x27;d come clean, and explained how what you were doing actually *helped* me, somehow, we could have worked together. But you would rather have had me in the dark and that&#x27;s not sustainable in a partnership.[SEP]A:I was trying to play both sides, and England was lying to me, and forwarding my press to try to incriminate me. So, yes, I lied, and so did England. I apologize.[SEP]A:Will you please either vote to draw, or let us know that you’d like to play this one out? I am finding it difficult to motivate myself to speak with anyone if the game is just going to draw shortly. Thoughts?[SEP]B:I did vote to 5-way draw! And I did so again for this season. So it’s not me who’s keeping this game alive[SEP]A:Well, as we approach the end of the academic study portion of the game, let me say once, with the truth detector activated, that I really enjoyed playing with you and thought you played really well.[SEP]A:Was it really your first game? You definitely played like a seasoned vet.[SEP]B:I really enjoyed playing with you, too! And yes, it really was my first game. Thanks for all your help and advice[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;[CLS]B:Hello there! What&#x27;s your general plan for this game? My inclination when I play Austria is to piss off as few people as possible, so I don&#x27;t plan on making any overtly aggressive moves this turn.[SEP]A:Hi Austria. Nice to meet you, and looking forward to playing as your neighbor. \\n\\nHmmmm, I hate playing as Italy. I rarely succeed. Frankly, I’ve recently tried early attacks on Austria, as Italy, AND IT KEEPS TURNING OUT POORLY. I’d really like to play this one as a tight-knit Central Trio if you have any appetite for that. Not sure if I should set up a Lepanto or go west, but I’d be happy to hear your thoughts on it.[SEP]B:That sounds good to me. I think probably what would work best is if you and Germany go west while Turkey and I contain and/or eat Russia, then once I&#x27;ve picked up some Russian dots and gotten some good position, you split your fleets to help me take Turkey and help Germany take England.[SEP]A:I like that. Let me talk it over with Germany.[SEP]A:I’m not sure whether Germany is keen on attacking France. Perhaps you and I should focus on Turkey?[SEP]B:Yeah, honestly, the more I think about it, the more I think it&#x27;ll just be easier to wipe turkey off the map really quickly. I&#x27;ve done it in tourneys a few times before and it just makes everything simpler.[SEP]A:👌 So I’ll open as a standard Lepanto. Sounds good.[SEP]A:Nice start!\\n\\nReally glad to see Turkey open north, and glad to see that you were true to your word with me. I feel like we’re in a really strong position to control the East!\\n\\nWhat are you thinking?[SEP]B:Yep! Good start, now we&#x27;ve just gotta follow through properly.[SEP]A:So, do I just convoy my army to Tunis?\\n\\nAlso, do you want me to bounce you in Trieste?[SEP]B:Sure, Trieste bounce is a good idea. And yeah, standard Lepanto with the convoy.[SEP]A:So...how shall we go about this? I’m kind of thinking that you and I should eat some Turkey.[SEP]B:That&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m thinking. I&#x27;m going to send Greece into the Aegean, you send Ionian into Eastern Med.[SEP]A:Okay. Cool! Do you mind if I take Greece this year while you take Bulgaria? That will keep us even, and should be guaranteed. I can just convoy an army to Greece in Spring while you move to Aegean, and I can support you to Bulgaria in the Fall. This also means you don’t have to rotate your armies all the way to Greece, which will allow you to mobilize against Russia faster when the time comes. \\n\\nThoughts?[SEP]A:Any thoughts on this idea?[SEP]A:I am going to send my fleet over to Eastern Med and we can work this out next turn.[SEP]B:Sorry about that, today got a little nuts. Figuring it out next turn is probably the best call, once we see what&#x27;s worked and what hasn&#x27;t.[SEP]A:Okay, thank you for being true to your word. \\n\\nI think we’re in great shape. My major concern on the board right now is E/F, which is likely going to take down Germany quickly and become a major force. \\n\\nIt is really important to me to get a build here so that I can try to keep France in check a bit. Will you agree that You get Bulgaria, I get Greece, and we can move forward with both of us at 5?\\n\\nI really think that the two of us can dominate this game if we keep working together.[SEP]B:Yep, I&#x27;m just fine with that.[SEP]A:Great!\\n\\nI will convoy Tunis to Greece. If you can support that move, that would be great. And it looks like you’ll have no problem supporting Greece to Bulgaria.[SEP]B:I&#x27;ll have a more direct response once the retreats are all resolved and I&#x27;m not extrapolating what the board state will probably be, but that seems eminently doable.[SEP]A:How’s it looking over there?[SEP]B:Looking solid! I don&#x27;t think we actually need to coordinate all that much, we&#x27;re in a really good position.[SEP]A:Just to be clear, should I expect Greece will be open?[SEP]B:Yep, it will be. I&#x27;ll want it back eventually, but for now it&#x27;s yours.[SEP]A:You, sir, are a terrific ally. This was more than you needed to do, but makes me feel like this is really a long term thing! Thank you.[SEP]B:We can do great things together, long term. I figured a down-payment now against that great future would be worth it.[SEP]B:Plus, you ever try digging out a talented Italy as Austria? It&#x27;s a pain in the fuckin neck! :P[SEP]A:🤗[SEP]A:Yeah, let’s just work together. Should be a good one for both of us.[SEP]A:What should I build? I’m pretty undecided and would be willing to let you choose.[SEP]B:I think probably a fleet will serve you best, in terms of flexibility. We&#x27;ve got Turkey, he&#x27;s doomed by numbers, so you want to start thinking France.[SEP]A:👌[SEP]A:Okay, how would you like to approach this turn? I’m at your disposal.[SEP]B:I think what we do is, AEG convoys GRE-SMY with support from EAS while BUL taps CON[SEP]B:That&#x27;s just an initial thought, though - if you have a better idea I&#x27;m all ears[SEP]A:My concern there is that Arm doesn’t have much to do other than support Smyrna, and I don’t know if we want to rely on Russia helping. I think he has a serious incentive to prevent us from succeeding too quickly against Turkey.[SEP]B:Very good point. Perhaps you tap SMY with EAS and I use AEG to support BUL-CON, with the intention of then doing the convoy in the fall?[SEP]A:What do you think of Aegean support Bul to Con while I cut support in Smy? That is guaranteed so long as Russia does not support Con back to Bul (unlikely), and we don’t have to tell Russia the complete plan.[SEP]A:Yes, we xposted, but we are thinking the same way.[SEP]B:Well it appears our messages passed each other in the internet&#x27;s series of tubes, but, great minds, etc etc[SEP]A:Good. Consider it done.[SEP]A:I’m thinking about sending an army over to Piedmont to keep France honest. Do you think that is a good idea or a terrible idea? I just want to avoid a stampede over Germany, and I feel like forcing him to use an army in Marseilles to bounce with me is worth dedicating one army from me. But I don’t want to antagonize I’ve him either. I keep going back and forth about it. What do you think?[SEP]B:I think probably we give France one season to see what they do. England build F LON and France built F BRE, which is something we should keep an eye on before moving.[SEP]A:Okay. If he does say anything to you about moving towards me, would you please let me know? I feel like he’s in an awfully strong position, and it makes me nervous.[SEP]B:You&#x27;ll be the first to know. Man, isn&#x27;t this game simpler when you&#x27;re being honest?[SEP]A:👍[SEP]B:France says they&#x27;re getting radio silence from England, which is probably good news for us.[SEP]B:Russia says you&#x27;re trying to get him to attack me, heh[SEP]A:That sounds like the kind of thing Russia would say. \\n\\nI have generally told Russia that I am not close with you and I’d be willing to attack you, but I’ve never “tried to get him to attack you. That is a complete 👎. \\n\\nOur alliance seems to be the one trusting alliance in the game. Everyone is going to try to break us up. We need to prevent it.[SEP]B:That&#x27;s about what I figured. Wanted to let you know it was being tried.[SEP]B:Also, England is extremely unhappy with France.[SEP]A:Yeah, sounds like England is attacking France. That’s good for us. We seem to be the only alliance that has its act together.[SEP]B:Which can mean only profit for us, as long as we stick together.[SEP]A:Word. \\n\\nListen, I’m an alliance player. That’s how I’ve always been. I think it’s the only way to play. I don’t like to shift around. I like a close working relationship with a partner. That’s what we have, and that’s what I plan to stick with as long as you’ll have me.[SEP]B:&#x27;til death or end of beta do us part, then 😛[SEP]A:That said, I don’t want anyone else to know that. So if people ask, I’ll tell them that I’d be happy to attack you.[SEP]B:Oh naturally, I&#x27;ll bullshit the hell outta everyone else.[SEP]B:Sooooooooo. Tyrolia?[SEP]B:Test[SEP]A:You don’t like it? I figured it was the same as Venice. If I wanted to attack you, I could have just moved to Trieste any time. \\n\\nMy purpose in Tyrolia is to keep Munich black. I’m just going to support Munich holding. I don’t want Germany to get trampled.[SEP]B:I&#x27;d have preferred a heads-up, is all.[SEP]B:So, we going with the same plan? I convoy Greece over to Smyrna?[SEP]A:Sorry — I’ve been slammed all day. Just looking at this again now.[SEP]A:Okay, I’m so sorry. I got distracted again. Yes! I will order GRE to SMY, EAS S GRE to SMY, TYR S MUN holding. \\n\\nWill you allow me a build this turn or do you plan on retaking Greece now?[SEP]B:Sounds good to me.[SEP]A:Any word on Greece?\\n\\nBasically, if I get a build this turn I can turn around and smash France. If I don’t, that will be a more tepid attack.[SEP]B:I&#x27;ve got no need to immediately take it, since I&#x27;m picking up Con.[SEP]A:Okay. Thank you. 😊[SEP]A:Hey, by the way, I am going to be candid here: I have thought about attacking you. I really have. But I have recently arrived at the conclusion that this would be a poor path forward. I’m not going to do it. \\n\\nI’ll move on France now. That will give you the peace of mind to know that my units will be occupied and far from you.[SEP]B:Glad to hear, yep![SEP]A:Let’s just keep right on working together, and press our advantage b[SEP]A:I suggest you move Alb to Ser and prepare to attack Russia in Spring.[SEP]A:You can have Ank, but I really do think it makes sense that I keep Greece. Ending up with 2 centers from Turkey/Balkans seems fair, with you getting everything else, yes?[SEP]B:Yeah, I think I can live with that.[SEP]B:Sorry it took me a moment to respond, it&#x27;s the MLB home run derby tonight[SEP]A:Well that, I can understand.[SEP]A:Look, like I said, I was wavering a bit, especially during the long weekend. But, I’ve taken a close look, and I just think that this alliance has unique staying power. I really do. We both have room to grow. Now that England attacked France, there isn’t really anyone who can stop us. This can work long term, and work well.[SEP]B:I wholeheartedly agree. Neither of us benefits from attacking the other.[SEP]A:So, This one seems easy. I’ll support you to Ankara, and you are guaranteed either Ankara or Rumania:\\n\\nCon - Ank\\nSmy S Con - Ank\\nAge - Con\\nEAS S Smy holding\\nVen - Pie\\nTyr S Mun holding\\nTYS - LYO\\nTun - WES\\nSer - Rum\\nBul S Ser - Rum\\nBud S Ser - Rum\\nVie - Gal\\n\\nSound right?[SEP]B:I had already entered every single one of those orders, except for AEG-CON, which is in now. It&#x27;s nice being on the same page, isn&#x27;t it?[SEP]A:👍[SEP]A:I kind of figured. It’s a pretty straight-forward move for both of us, and likely gains for both of us. This alliance is in a really healthy place.[SEP]B:So, I assume you&#x27;re going to support Ank to hold?[SEP]B:Also, fyi, I&#x27;m in transit to SkyCon out in Montana, so I might not be the most communicative gent this weekend.[SEP]A:Hi Austria. I apologize for the delay. Quite a busy day for me yesterday. \\n\\nI have no problem supporting Ank to hold.[SEP]A:I also want to say — looks like that support ensures you get two builds. My own attack on France is not quite so successful. Do you mind if I borrow Trieste this turn to stay even with you and keep my momentum going west. I’ll place another fleet with it, which further locks me in moving away from you. I think that’s actually quite good for you, but I know some players get prickly about home centers.[SEP]B:A dot is a dot is a dot. It&#x27;s better for the long term health of the alliance, and I&#x27;m still building one. More importantly, your best/easiest route to growth still lies in France, not with me, so I don&#x27;t see you having a ton of incentive to go after me. Go for it.[SEP]A:OMG. 😮 You are my favorite ally of all time. This just happened. You just past the threshold. It used to be this guy who was playing France to my England. Funny dude. Great stories. But he never sacrificed a home center in the interest of parity. \\n\\nYou are a rare gem.[SEP]A:Do you think 17-17 is an okay result for a beta test?[SEP]A:I feel like I can’t stab you now. So I’d like to simply crush the board with you.[SEP]B:I&#x27;ve never said no to 17/17, lol[SEP]B:What&#x27;s your planned build?[SEP]A:F Nap. Sound good?[SEP]B:Yeah, Naples makes it look like we might actually be fighting, go for it.[SEP]A:Well, I hope you had a nice weekend. Do you think we have much to discuss here? Is there anything you’d like me to do with my three eastern units? Do you want me to pretend to fight you, or shall I just move away or hold still? I don’t really have any idea what I should be doing.[SEP]B:My weekend was great! I placed 8th at SkyCon, which was a disproportionately talented tourney, so I&#x27;m feeling quite good about myself. I&#x27;d like your army in Smyrna to support my move from Ankara to Armenia, but other than that, I see no point in pretending to fight each other, so I figure you might as well move stuff west to take care of your new main front.[SEP]A:Okay, that works for me.[SEP]A:Do you want me to move Eastern Med to Aegean? If your move to Armenia works (likely), you may want to use my fleet to bounce with you at Con to keep The Russian fleet out. But totally up to you. I don’t care either way.[SEP]B:Right now I&#x27;ve just got my fleet in Con tapping Black, so it&#x27;ll probably stay full. Get the fleet where it can help with France.[SEP]A:Thoughts on where we go from here?[SEP]A:My units are at your disposal.[SEP]A:I think the best way to take Rum would look like this:\\nBul - Rum\\nSer and Bud S Bul - Rum\\nCon - Bul (EC)\\nArm and Smy bounce in Ank\\nTyr and Gal bounce in Vienna\\n (Anticipating that Black Sea will likely move to Bul to cut support)[SEP]A:Everything still okay?[SEP]B:I like it, yeah, let&#x27;s do that.[SEP]B:Folks are trying to pry us apart, but their arguments aren&#x27;t making a ton of sense.[SEP]A:Yeah, I’m getting the same treatment. \\n\\nIf we stay together, we win together.[SEP]A:Argh! I KNEW Black Sea would try for Bulgaria!!! Shoot![SEP]A:My wife says I am bossy and uniquely inflexible. I don’t want you to feel that way too! How shall we approach this next turn? I think we need to put in a good set of orders here to turn the tide against Russia.[SEP]B:Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve got right now: \\nA Arm - Sev\\nF BLA - Con\\nA Bud S Gal - Rum\\nA Gal - Rum\\nA Rum - Bul\\nA Ser S Rum - Bul[SEP]B:I figure if you bounce me in Con, that piffs the Russian fleet.[SEP]A:Yeah, not bad. The danger is in Rumania. Are you thinking Gal - Ukr, Bud - Rum? Shall I order Tyr - Vie?\\n\\nI think that is likely best as it keeps Russia out of your centers for sure, and it should easy to support me out in the Fall once Russia has one less unit.[SEP]B:Yep, that seems like the best course of action.[SEP]A:So look, I’m at your disposal in the east. I think the best bet may be for you to support me from Vienna to Galicia, but I’m willing to do something else if you like something else better.[SEP]A:Frankly, if I were you, I’d be worried about a stab from Italy here. 🤭 But I’m not going to do that. You e been extremely good to me. And it would be a very bad time for me to begin a war in the east while all my units are west. So you’re stuck with me as an ally.[SEP]B:Yep, that all checks out, and I was thinking Vie-Gal was the best call, so let&#x27;s make that happen.[SEP]A:Well that is damn annoying. I’m surprised he tried for Vienna — would have thought he would go for Rumania.[SEP]A:I do think that we can guarantee you Sev this year, which should finally crack this nut.[SEP]B:Yeah. I&#x27;d also like to address the center imbalance a bit more directly - as you pick up dots in the west, I&#x27;d like to start picking Greece, Vienna, and Ankara back up.[SEP]B:Er, Smyrna, not Ankara.[SEP]A:Totally agree.[SEP]A:Yes, we need to take that in swiftly. Let’s see what the builds look like and make a plan.[SEP]A:Hi Austria — So, this is a big turn for us. I am absolutely committed to getting you a build. I wish we could get you more than one, but unfortunately the fact that you lost Vienna last turn makes that impossible. \\n\\nSo, it seems to me that the most important way to get you a build is to take Galicia in Spring. I don’t care if I move there, or you move there, but we need to make some room around Budapest so that you can build there.[SEP]B:Yeah, I&#x27;d appreciate your support from Bud-Gal.[SEP]A:Maybe something like this:\\nBud - Gal\\nVie S Bud - Gal\\nRum - Sev\\nBLS S Rum - Sev\\nArm S Rum - Sev\\nBul - Rum\\nSer - Bud\\n\\nIf the move to Gal does not work, and you don’t get Sev, then in Fall you can order Bud - Tri while Vie and Ser bounce in Bud to ensure you get a build.[SEP]B:Oh yeah that looks better than what I had in mind. Let&#x27;s roll with that.[SEP]A:👍[SEP]A:One tweak: I am worried that Russia could take Rumania with the move set I proposed. You can prevent that by having Serbia support Bul - Rum. I think that’s better than Ser - Bud, and it makes sense because you want Bud open after the Fall anyway. That should mean that you won’t lose any ground this turn, and you’ll likely take Sev.[SEP]B:Oh yeah, good tweak, makes sense. So ordered.[SEP]A:Hey — man, Russia keeps guessing correctly. I am sincerely sorry that that move did not work. \\n\\nThoughts on what to do this turn? I wish England or Germany would pick off a Russia. Center in the north, but they seem content to let Russia put up his road block.[SEP]B:Use Tyrolia to tap Bohemia, Vienna supports Budapest to Galicia, and Rumania taps Ukraine. Unless Bohemia goes to Vienna, that guarantees a move to Galicia.[SEP]B:Also, for my comfort, do you mind if I pick Trieste back up?[SEP]A:I like that. I was thinking that you would move Bud back to Tri, but this is much better. It keeps forward momentum. And yes, you should take back Tri now. That will make builds easier as we move forward.[SEP]B:Also, actually, I don&#x27;t have anything for Bulgaria to do, and you&#x27;re guaranteed two dots this turn. Can I take Greece back too? I can bank a build for the future regardless of what happens, and you stay even. You don&#x27;t really need a build right now.[SEP]A:Hmmm. I’m cool with you taking Trieste. I’m not sure that taking Greece now is the right move. \\n\\nIn the West, I will take Liverpool, but not Portugal. I need to use my Spanish fleet to support MAO so that I can convoy an army to Liverpool. And I’m just in no hurry to take out France. So if you take Greece, you would be taking an Italian unit off the board and not building one yourself.[SEP]A:Also, seems like there is plenty of risk that Russia could try for Rumania. Why not use Bulg to support Rum, while having Rum and BLS Support Arm to Sev?[SEP]A:All that said, if you feel like you need to take two from me this turn in order to keep working with me, I can live with that.[SEP]A:The alliance is much more important to me than the dot.[SEP]B:I&#x27;ll take another look at it and get back to you.[SEP]A:Oh man. I’m getting a lot of hate mail out west. Not fun. I think Germany has a pretty low opinion of me, and it sounds like she and Russia are developing a bit of a romance. \\n\\nI am totally cool with you taking back Trieste this turn, and I am thankful that you loaned it to me in the first place. But I’d prefer if you wait to take Greece until you can actually use the build. It would make things quite a bit tougher for me if I have to take a unit off the board especially if we don’t get an extra unit in the east to compensate.[SEP]B:Yeah, if you&#x27;re not picking up Portugal, then I&#x27;ll let Greece be.[SEP]A:Argh. I blew it!\\n\\nI’m sorry. You were a terrific ally. I misread the board and thought that I had a clear solo run. England basically told me that he was going to help me solo, so I felt like I ought to just go for it. He bamboozled me, and for me to stab you. It was a mistake. My sincerest apologies.[SEP]B:I mean, I&#x27;m gonna have to fight you for at least a little bit. We&#x27;ll see what happens.[SEP]A:Yeah, I get that. It makes me sick because it’s likely that you’ll just get squeezed between me and Russia. Fighting me is not really a path toward viability for you, and that’s my fault. \\n\\nI’m sorry this happened. I really am. I misjudged the situation and I fear I’ve ruined both our games. If you can stick around and insist on getting some of the fruits of smashing me and not letting Russia get them all, that would be justice.[SEP]B:Oh, I&#x27;m definitely sticking around, and if you want to make it easier for me to pick up some dots, that&#x27;d go a long way to making me more viable and more inclined to resume the alliance.[SEP]A:Good.[SEP]A:I’m game for a draw if you guys want to wrap it up here.[SEP]B:I&#x27;d take a draw.[SEP]A:Sounds like Germany is the holdout.[SEP]A:I’m so mad at myself for taking the bait last turn. I had both Russia and England urging me to go for a solo, and it was just stupid of me to believe them. \\n\\nI’m going to try to leave both Tri and Bud open to you this turn. All yours.[SEP]A:Sent to Germany, England, Austria, Russia: So, England, Germany, Russia, y’all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would “teach him” and help his along to second place. Then y’all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)[SEP]A:(Part 2)\\nAt this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I’m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for “Hey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,” but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that’s really my preference. \\n\\nI am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo. And I’m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I’m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany’s favor. \\n\\nI propose that we draw and hug it out.🤗[SEP]B:I believe everyone is in for the draw. I&#x27;ve got it set, and I&#x27;m set for early adjudication.[SEP]A:Do you think this game is going to draw?[SEP]B:So, did you veto the draw?[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;[CLS]B:Buongiorno! \\nBe kinda nice to know if you&#x27;re looking to move in a direction I might be interested in participating in. I fully understand if it&#x27;s too early to know, just know that channels and minds are both open .[SEP]A:Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen. \\n\\nI’m not writing to anyone else until I get things squared away with you. I LOVE the Wintergreen alliance. It works in the short-term (we only need to get A/T to fight) and it works in the long-term (resolves East before West, and we can’t really stab each other). Can we do this?\\n\\nI don’t care if we target T first or A first. I’ll let you decide. But I want to work as your partner. I am just hoping that you’re brilliant and fun too!\\n\\nI literally will not message anyone else until you and I have a plan. I want it to be clear to you that you’re the ally I want.[SEP]B:Well, Italy and France are, in my opinion, some of the best possible partners for Russia, so how could I possibly turn down such enthusiastic overtures from one of them?[SEP]A:Lovely. Would you rather we target Turkey first or Austria? I’m okay either way.[SEP]B:To be perfectly honest, that&#x27;s hard to say right now, since the decision doesn&#x27;t really affect my opening moves any (the standard southern opening spring moves are equally useful against either one), and I&#x27;d likely need to adjust based on what else happens on the Spring turn. Easiest just to say I&#x27;m opening South, flexibly considering the follow-through against either one of them.[SEP]A:Okay. Fair enough. One reason it might matter is because I could open with an aggressive attack on Austria if you want to blitz him quickly (e.g., DMZ Gal and then break it). Or you could organize a bounce in Gal and then not move there. On the other hand, if you’d prefer to take out Turkey first, I could go the standard Lepanto route. I’m happy to go either way, but I’d really like to coordinate with you if you’re game.\\n\\nMaybe we both need a fuller picture of what is happening first. I’ll begin to reach out to others now.[SEP]B:Sounds great - and here&#x27;s where it&#x27;s useful to know Austria has already indicated a bounce in Galicia, so opportunity to blitz him through there is severely limited.[SEP]A:Okay, that’s good to know. Thank you. I sent Austria a general first message offering friendship. I’ll let you know how things play out.[SEP]A:Hearing anything interesting? Both Austria and Turkey are acting cagey and conservative with me so far.[SEP]A:Hey, so, Austria seems to want to Lepanto now. \\n\\nYou’re still the ally I want. And I’d like either to cut down Austria quickly or cut down Turkey quickly. \\n\\nIf we decide to take out Austria first, I’d like you to let Austria in to Gal (just tell him this was a mistake). This will make it very hard for him to defend against me.\\n\\nIf we decide to take out Turkey first, bounce Austria, and I’ll open as a traditional Lepanto.\\n\\nThoughts?[SEP]B:Let&#x27;s do Turkey first. I&#x27;ll bounce Galicia[SEP]A:👌[SEP]A:Hi Russia, how’s it going? I hope this turn finds you well. \\n\\nI think my move is going to be fairly boring, but I’m still game for some adventure if you have any ideas. \\n\\nAlso, would you mind asking Austria for a bounce again in Galicia? I’d just like to have a decent sense of what his units are doing. \\n\\nAny other thoughts?[SEP]B:Can do.[SEP]B:He doesn&#x27;t seem that interested in a Galicia bounce, fwiw[SEP]A:Okay, thank you for letting me know. That helps![SEP]A:I believe that Turkey is in for a world of hurt soon. I think you just need to expel that yellow army from Sev, and you should be in for a swift turnaround. \\n\\nLet’s kill Turkey, and then we kill Austria. Long live Wintergreen.[SEP]B:That&#x27;s the plan, mate[SEP]B:That went reasonably well. Looks like Austria is going to pick up Greece, so get wherever you can get and I&#x27;ll get you into doors where I can[SEP]B:Obviously Bulgaria, not Greece[SEP]A:Awesome. Thank you Russia. Any chance you can tap Black Sea this turn? I’m planning to take Greece, but I need Austria’s move to Bulgaria to succeed.[SEP]B:His move is guaranteed[SEP]A:What am I missing? It looks like it’s only guaranteed if you tap BLS. Otherwise, 3 - 3.[SEP]B:It&#x27;s 4-3. Rum, Ser, Gre, Aeg[SEP]A:Ah, cool. I did not realize that Rum was supporting Gre to Bul. That works too! Thank you.[SEP]A:Hi friend: can you please NOT support England into Denmark? I think that the last thing we want to see here is E/F trample over Germany. I feel like this is really important. Thoughts?[SEP]B:Ah, I did not see this in time. And one of the upshots was learning that England talks too damn much, so I probably won&#x27;t be helping him much going forward 😃[SEP]A:I feel like, perhaps it’s time to go all out against both T and A here? Something like this:\\nVen - Tri\\nWar - Gal\\nRum - BLS\\nSev S Ukr - Rum\\n\\nI may lose Greece this year, but I feel like it’s worth it to gain some momentum. \\n\\nThoughts?[SEP]A:Hi Russia,\\n\\nMy moves very much depend on you here so I’m looking forward to hearing from you. I think this is the right time for us both to hit Austria, but I’m not going to do it if you’re not on board. \\n\\nThoughts?[SEP]B:Hey, sorry -focused on guests for the holiday. I&#x27;m currently ordered to move units around so I can move on Austria, without moving on him this turn. Basically getting the fleet out of the way.[SEP]A:Okay. Let’s shoot for next turn. Thank you![SEP]A:Russia, argh....\\n\\nI sincerely want to work with you man. Truly. But if you sell me out and try to use what I tell you against me, it makes it really hard. \\n\\nAustria went right back to me and told me that you sold me out.[SEP]A:I want to move beyond this. But I need to know that what I tell you stays between us, or else I just can’t trust you and I can’t speak with you. \\n\\nI’d like to hear your side of this story. And I’d like to know that you’re not just going to tell Austria again. Let’s use this bump in the road as a lesson to work better together.[SEP]B:Eh? Are you really claiming I&#x27;ve been telling him anything useful, given that I said nothing about Greece?\\nI mean, that looked kinda arranged to me, but nonetheless I gave him no heads up about your plan to move in, which should make it pretty clear I have no intention of passing on potentially useful info to him. 😀[SEP]A:So, where do we stand now?[SEP]B:You&#x27;re in the driver&#x27;s seat for path forward. I&#x27;m going to take Ankara, I assume you&#x27;ve negotiated the taking of Smyrna. Austria either needs to be given a path forward or dealt with, and England most likely needs dealt with. So... You have lots of options on path forward, and I&#x27;m mostly inclined to Ride along as most of my attention is likely to be in the North.[SEP]A:Well, here is my honest assessment: if you want to work with me, you have to commit to attack Austria with me. If you’re not interested in that, I’m not going to attack Austria, and it will basically be his choice whether he wants to attack me next or attack you next.[SEP]A:Frankly, I am still a little wary after the last time we discussed this, you ratted me out to Austria. But I can get over that if you actually want to be my partner.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m still not really sure how you think I &quot;rated you out&quot; to Austria given that I&#x27;ve really told him nothing useful at all. Greece was the test of that -even though I&#x27;m retrospect it&#x27;s obvious it was an arrangement, it&#x27;s also obvious I didn&#x27;t say anything to him when I thought you were stabbing him[SEP]B:But whatever, water under the bridge. I&#x27;m willing to move on Austria as soon as you give the word. I thought that&#x27;s what I pretty much just said -I&#x27;ll follow your lead in the South. You want to roll? Let&#x27;s roll.[SEP]B:Orders are in, moves on Austria, up to you to join in.[SEP]A:What moves on Austria would you like to see, and what have you ordered? I’ll make the move now if it makes sense. If not now, then next turn.[SEP]B:Yeah, you missed me after I&#x27;d gone to bed, but as you can see I did make the move on him, and we are apparently spoiling for a fight. Of course, with you reoriented the way you are, seems unlikely you&#x27;re on board for continuing that line of discussion.[SEP]A:Well, I’m not completely opposed. I build an army in Venice, after all. What are you thinking?[SEP]B:I mean, the only decision point is Ank/Smy/Con, right? That&#x27;s just a matter of choosing the mover - everything else is straightforward one-power tactics[SEP]A:Well, we should really talk to each other more.[SEP]B:Ya think?[SEP]B:FWIW, I&#x27;m still on board with cooperating to take down Austria, if that wasn&#x27;t obvious[SEP]A:I’m not sure I can save the Bulgarian fleet this turn, but I think you would help yourself by taking Galicia.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m not sure you have a vested interest in saving my fleet in any event -you&#x27;d much rather be the undisputed fleet power. And that&#x27;s just fine.[SEP]A:Well, either way, I can’t help. But I do think you can take Gal without problem.[SEP]B:That was already the plan, and then he walked out anyway. \\nAnyway, my course is both set and obvious, so it&#x27;s really just a question of if you&#x27;re going to take all the free dots. 😀[SEP]A:Will you be around near the deadline this turn?[SEP]B:Monday at noon ET? Yeah, I should be available around that time.[SEP]A:😎[SEP]A:Hi Russia, still there?[SEP]A:Russia!? Come back![SEP]B:Yes, I&#x27;m here[SEP]A:Cool. Any chance you’d like to team up with me and England?[SEP]B:I mean, sure. My goal right now is just to hammer Austria, and that coalition helps further that goal, so...[SEP]A:Cool. I expect Vienna will be empty this turn. Boh - Vie should be a winner.[SEP]A:Ahh...BOH - Vienna. Why’d you try to take it from Gal?[SEP]B:Didn&#x27;t log in fast enough to change it. And not really upset about it, either - this way my line is still mostly intact, which is a bit of a priority until you make an overtly anti-Austrian move.[SEP]A:Fair enough. At least you can see that I was sincere.[SEP]B:Aye. As was I. 😀[SEP]A:So, how are things going over there Comrade?[SEP]A:I’m feeling like it’s just about time for you and me to make things official and go steady.[SEP]A:I believe that England would like me to support you to Munich in the Fall. And that’s possible. But perhaps getting you to Budapest might work out better for you? I don’t know — how do you the board right now?[SEP]B:Things are pretty well. Yes, this looks to be the year you can just quietly slip the knife in and take pretty much everything.[SEP]B:And I&#x27;m easy either way -no need to make that call right now, as this is the boring turn for me[SEP]A:Well...if I “take everything,” then we end up with a boring, large draw. I’m not in solo position. So, believe it or not, I’d rather you get the spoils out East. If I get much bigger, I’ll be fighting the whole board, and I’ll lose that fight.[SEP]B:Well, damn, guess I can&#x27;t bamboozle you into that position then. :)[SEP]A:Eh — I think it’s a better position for you to get a bunch of centers and work as a team anyway. Beats a five-way draw.[SEP]A:Shall we get you Budapest or Munich this year?[SEP]A:I think Austria is likely to try to retake some of his centers this year, so you may have some openings regardless.[SEP]B:Presumably Budapest is the better option, but again I&#x27;m not really moving much in the spring, so it&#x27;s easy to remain noncommittal on that right this moment. Unless you&#x27;re making a hard move right now, which I doubt - you also benefit from the likely ability to just walk in on the fall.[SEP]B:Alright, now it&#x27;s specific planning time. And Munich clearly doesn&#x27;t seem to make much sense now.[SEP]A:Okay, Let’s get you into Rumania and Budapest this turn. I think I can do that, as Austria wants to take Trieste and Greece, which will open up room to maneuver. As far as I know, Ser is moving to Tri and Bul is moving to Gre. I think that you can take out Bud/Rum with Gal - Bud (supported by Vie) and Sev - Rum (supported by Ukr). The trick will be keeping Sev safe, but I think we can do that too, as I can recommend that Austria self-bounce there to keep me honest.[SEP]A:I am picking up some gains out west, so I risk a severe backlash if I gain anything in the east. I’d love to see you pick up two here and take a bit of the pressure off me.[SEP]B:I can work with that. Grrr. Out tonight, so less stability to chat, but I&#x27;m with you here.[SEP]A:👌[SEP]B:Is this thing back on?[SEP]B:Ah, good. Nice run in the West you have going there[SEP]B:I&#x27;d probably be trying to push a stop the leader narrative right now, except Mitch hasn&#x27;t talked to me since I pointed out that rolling on me was only going to net him two dots before he hit a wall, and that was two or three years ago. So... Eff him. 😀[SEP]A:Sent to Germany, England, Austria, Russia: So, England, Germany, Russia, y’all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would “teach him” and help his along to second place. Then y’all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)[SEP]A:(Part 2)\\nAt this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I’m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for “Hey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,” but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that’s really my preference. \\n\\nI am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo.

I&#x27;m guessing you and Austria will be pals, you and France will be rivals?[SEP]A:Well good luck to you too! No idea yet who is a friend. Have you heard anything interesting?[SEP]B:I have some agreements with France. If those are upheld, I&#x27;d bet France goes for Por and Spain in 1901. You might want to ask about whether a fleet gets built in Mar during the 1901 build, if you haven&#x27;t already, as this would be an indicator of aggression towards you.[SEP]B:Germany seems like a bit of a wild card. Haven&#x27;t talked in depth with Austria.[SEP]B:Do you have any sort of aggression in your opening, or are you just planning to be neutral and secure Tun?[SEP]A:You know, I really haven’t decided. I’m trying to get clear answers from my neighbors, and they are all pretty slow to answer. So I really haven’t decided. Is there something you want me to do?[SEP]B:Well definitely make sure you get your fleet to Tun by the fall. I&#x27;d like to see you do well, as Italy is kind of the underdog on the map. Have you agreed to France about Piedmont at all?[SEP]A:No, we have not yet talked about Piedmont.[SEP]B:Well, if you&#x27;re looking to make France a little nervous, that would be your move. Ven - Pie, Rom - Ven, Nap to TYS.[SEP]B:Then you secure Tun with your fleet in the fall. For the unit in Pie, you can decide to bait France into a bounce in Mar, but then just hold instead. France would move from Spain to Mar and miss securing the fifth supply center. This is certainly aggressive, but it also keeps you and France on a more level playing field.[SEP]A:Well, I’d be inclined to do that if I knew you were moving to the Channel and Wales. If you want for both of us to go all in at the same time, then let’s go.[SEP]B:Yeah, that makes sense. Unfortunately we&#x27;ve declared a DMZ in the channel through 1902, so I can&#x27;t commit to the stab right now. I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an awful play for you. If France gets a fleet in Mar and has one parked in Spain s.c. at the start of 1902, that&#x27;s going to be a little threatening for you.[SEP]A:(1) If you’ve declared a DMZ, then you ARE in position to do this if you want to do it. (2) I’m not going to attack France on my own.[SEP]B:Yeah, everything you&#x27;re saying makes sense. When I make specific agreements like the DMZ, I generally try to hold them, especially early game. Honestly, I&#x27;d rather the three of us pick apart germany to start. Maybe we could convince France to help you into Munich in the Fall?[SEP]A:Hi England — just sort of checking in to hear how things are going. How does the board look to you right now?[SEP]B:Great time to check in. France and Germany are in conflict, and don&#x27;t seem poised to collaborate on invading me, which I&#x27;m happy about. Russia&#x27;s looking a little troubled with losing Sev. You look poised to lepanto to turkey, and it looks like you&#x27;ll pull it off without the Austrian convoy, unless that new fleet is headed west. Also, I feel like you and/or Austria may have your eyes on Munich.[SEP]A:Any thoughts here?[SEP]B:Just about the state of the board? Or did you send a message after mine that didn’t come through?[SEP]A:Ah, I sent a really long message about Germany. You didn’t get it?[SEP]B:Nah. Maybe it was a bot-killer message[SEP]B:Probably best to split it up[SEP]A:Rats.[SEP]A:Here is an image of the message I sent.[SEP]A:I’ve been on pins and needles for two days awaiting a response!!![SEP]B:Haha sorry about that. No image received. The bot may not send them through[SEP]A:Ahhhhhhh![SEP]A:Now I have to retype it👎👎👎[SEP]A:I have kind of an odd favor to ask. And I happen to know it’s in your best interest, but it will require a big picture, long-term sort of view of the game. \\n\\nThis is Germany’s very first game of Diplomacy. And he’s clearly in over his head. You’re positioned to smash him. There’s no doubt about that. But the real winner if you do that is France. (End part 1)[SEP]A:France has FOUR armies, and now he has a wide open runway to roll right over Germany. If you help him, you’re going to regret it. Look two game years ahead, France is going to be in a crazy good position. \\n\\nOn the other hand, if you change course now and go get France instead, France is NEVER going to be able to build a second fleet. He will be so much easier to destroy. And Germany is so green...he’ll be much easier to take down second. \\n\\nI just...I can see where this is headed. I know it’s attractive just to take that easy build. But that is the apple of knowledge and France is the devilish serpent (end part 2)[SEP]A:I really REALLY believe that it’s better for you and me for you to switch course and take out France now. I’d be happy to help and give you most of the spoils. And I think this would be a great springboard for a dominant England/Italian alliance that can win this game. If only I could get this message to go through....\\n(End)[SEP]B:All of this is fair. I’m aware that germany’s a first-timer, and I ran through similar reasoning to yours when trying to choose who to side with.[SEP]B:If I had known where you stood in this, it might have swayed my opinion. I was worried about you and austria making a play for Munich and then Russia applying more pressure in the north.[SEP]B:One additional piece of my reasoning is that France is a stronger player than me and others probably know this. After Germany is gone, France is the bigger threat. If Germany and I had taken France together, I would have ended up the bigger threat (i.e. the next target).[SEP]B:I’m going to get Russia in on the German takedown. You really think the three of us can’t handle france together once germany is gone?[SEP]B:Can you tell germany to self-bounce in ruhr? Unless i’m missing something, that line holds until i support into holland (which I haven’t been asked to do yet). The French upside to taking on germany can be contained. If you get Munich out of this, do you still think it’s a bad plan?[SEP]A:I vehemently do not want Munich.[SEP]B:Also i’m wayy wrong it’s a fleet in holland haha[SEP]A:I do think it is a much better plan for both of us to side with Germany against France. I just think that France could pull in Austria or Turkey against me and he could pull in Russia against you. \\n\\nGermany won’t do that sort of counter.[SEP]A:The more I look at this board, the more I want to focus on an E/I Alliance. And I think the only thing standing in our way is France. I don’t see Germany as any kind of obstacle at all.[SEP]A:Especially given that France is locked into armies right now, not fleets, I think we would be wasting a real opportunity if we let France grow a bit more.[SEP]A:I’m sorry I did not come to you with this earlier. That’s just my bad. I’ve been kind of lazy, and I wasn’t really sure I wanted to weigh in about the west at all. But, I’ve changed my mind?\\n\\nI think E/I can dominate here. But we’ve got to keep France from ever building a second fleet. I think that’s the way that both you and me get really big.[SEP]B:I see your points, but a couple of things: 1) France has another build guaranteed this year, and that will likely be a fleet, 2) We may be able to keep France away from all of the German supply centers[SEP]B:Kie and Mun bounce in Ruh, Hol cuts support from Bel. This holds Ruh unless France chooses to send Bel in and let Germany into Holland.[SEP]B:This holds the line unless I give support.[SEP]B:What if Austria gets Munich?[SEP]B:I stabbed Germany, and so I’m hesitant to try collaboration now.[SEP]B:Ok, ok. I’m open to going against france. I messaged germany. We’ll see how she responds. I’m taking denmark this year regardless. The stab on france would involve me taking the channel unexpectedly next spring and helping germany into belgium maybe[SEP]A:These are all good responses. And I get that you don’t want to turn around and stab France now. \\n\\nI do think that I can help you diplomatically with Germany. I think that, if you really want to work with me and Germany, I can get G on board.[SEP]B:Alright, well we can chat next year after builds then. I’m certainly open to it. I told germany to not bother saving denmark (it’s guaranteed for me with Russian support) amd instead do the self bounce in Ruh with Kei and Mun to keep France out, cutting support in Bel with Hol. I think that move is important this fall to keep France out.[SEP]B:France just tried to tell me the Brest build was anti-Italian haha[SEP]A:Funny enough, he tells me it’s anti-English.[SEP]B:Haha. So are we still both anti-French?[SEP]B:I’d like to get germany on board with helping me take the channel (or at least not stopping me). I’m sure germany would be excited to hit me back though :/. I’ll play dumb with France for now[SEP]A:Okay, I’ll try to get Germany on board.[SEP]B:Germany seems on board. Maybe i’m setting myself up to get stabbed. Hope i’m backing the right horse on this one. I’ll shoot for the channel in the spring and then we get germany into belgium. Are you planning to move west?[SEP]B:Was hoping to see something a little more anti-french in your moves. My homeland is toast if you don’t put any pressure on France in the south.[SEP]A:Hi England — I’m sorry for the delay![SEP]A:I can move to attack France in the Spring if you like. For now, I think that mobilizing Germany to attack France is your best bet (and shouldn’t be too hard).[SEP]A:You know what? This isn’t really fair of me. If you will commit to the France attack, I’ll move on him now. Are you ready to go all out against him? This could actually work out really well for both of us.[SEP]B:I’m ready, but i may want your advice on some of the tactics. My plan is to completely cold shoulder France in negotiations and start an attack. We’ll want to get germany on board, but I think Germany is playing a bit neutral for survival purposes right now.[SEP]A:I agree with regard to Germany’s strategy, but I believe he hates France most and he will be with you if both you and I move on France now. \\n\\nFrance is getting no builds. Let’s just put the clamps on now! I will move to TYS and Tun if you will move either to take Belgium, or to position your fleets at Irish/Channel. \\n\\nIf we both take the plunge, there is nothing he can do.[SEP]B:France can support himself into England though, and I think he plans to because he was asking for Germany to cut support in Nth (which she plans not to). The only way to hold the channel is to support from Nth.[SEP]B:into England =&amp;gt; into English channel[SEP]B:I&#x27;m planning army yorkshire to wales, which allows for the convoy through the channel next year, and allows me to bounce in Lvp if France moves to IRI[SEP]A:Okay, I buy that. If you commit to moving the army to Wales and you don’t attack Germany, I’ll move on France.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m committed. Are you planning to cut support in Munich for a Russian invasion of Berlin?[SEP]A:No way. I am supporting Munich. We don’t want Russia or France rolling over Germany. Germany will give us her centers in time. Let’s keep them German until that time comes.[SEP]A:Can you use Den to cut support in Baltic if I make sure Germany does not retake Den?[SEP]B:Germany has to do something else with Munich? To protect Ruhr I guess?[SEP]B:go team![SEP]A:Cool. Let’s do this.[SEP]B:Are you LYO and WES this Spring with the fleets? And will Venice go to Pie? Also, what is your communication with France like? I&#x27;m in favor of all three of us going totally dark on France until the job is done. And at some point we should talk about a fair split of the French supply centers just so there&#x27;s no surprises.[SEP]A:Yes, those are my moves.[SEP]A:And I don’t have any dialogue with France right now. I suppose that’s lazy. You want me to stay quiet or try to feel him out? There is no way he will believe anything I say after my last move.[SEP]B:I kind of want to starve him of info. I’m currently giving him radio silence. Germany is getting some inside info, pretending to be friendly, etc. but that will end shortly (assuming I don’t see a surprise german stab of cutting the nth channel support, but i think it’s unlikely).[SEP]B:France apparently plans to move out of Ruh, probably to defend the south. France will lose 1 supply center certainly, maybe 2 this year[SEP]B:What are your thoughts on a divvy up of you in Mar and Spa, me in Bre and Por, and germany in Bel and Par? Just thinking long term about who gets what.[SEP]A:Thanks for that info about France. \\n\\nAlso, Germany has confirmed to me that they trust you. I think you’re right that there will be no German stab coming this turn.[SEP]A:As far as that divide, that generally sounds fair. Though, I find that those kinds of agreed splits rarely come to pass exactly as proposed. I may have to turn around and go east if Austria stabs me, etc.[SEP]A:So I’d prefer to kind of focus on general principles: (1) I’d like for the dominant alliance on the board to be E/I. So while I agree we want Germany to help us crack this but, longer term I think we should plan to divide Germany’s share too. The safest divide in that case might leave me with all of Iberia, while you get most of Germany (I.e., you’re going to need armies).[SEP]A:(2) We should focus on parity. In other words, if I’m way ahead on centers when France folds, you get more of France. If it’s the opposite, I get more. We just keep checking in and try to balance both centers and growth opportunities, and let that guide us.[SEP]B:All of that makes sense. We’ll reevaluate as we go. I’d like the promise of Belgium and Paris to Germany to be a consistent one that comes from both of us, for the purpose of maintaining German confidence in our alliance. In case germany asks you.[SEP]B:Looks like you’ve got a bit of a guessing game on your hands.[SEP]A:Yep. Was hoping for a guarantee. 🤨[SEP]B:Germany and I were thinking to go with Spain. France is annoyed enough with me that he honestly may go for the channel. I’ll be risking the channel by supporting ruh to bel with nth. So you can support to spain and then let france into mar from bur instead of bouncing. Germany will try to sneak into bur from Mun, then you two could bounce in Mun to keep russia out. A little complicated, but germany in bur next year would be great for us.[SEP]B:Even if things don’t go our way this fall, france will go eventually. Though the longer france has to stay alive, the longer he’ll have to sweet-talk germany into turning on us[SEP]B:Trieste? What&#x27;s up with that?[SEP]B:I guess it shows commitment to an English-Italian alliance, but I&#x27;m a little surprised to see a stab like that this soon.[SEP]A:Not a stab. Austria offered it to me for the sake of parity.[SEP]A:Hmmm, maybe I was supposed to keep that a secret? I think you need to give Austria some “thumbs down”[SEP]A:Can you please not go to Austria and tell him that I said the move to Trieste was arranged? He’s obviously trying to manipulate you in some way. Can we just compare notes and try to figure out what he’s up to without revealing that you and I talk much?[SEP]B:I&#x27;m not going to right now, but I also am a little curious why it would matter to you if I told Austria that. Are you telling Austria things like &quot;I really want the Austria-Italy alliance to be the dominant one on the board&quot;? What is your long-term plan with Austria?[SEP]A:No — I just want to know what he’s up to. It’s not a big deal to me, but I didn’t know he was going to try to pass that off as him getting stabbed, so I’m curious what he’ll tell you next. If you blow him up for lying to you, we won’t get that info, and he’ll know that you and I talk a lot.[SEP]A:In terms of what I am telling Austria, I am definitely close with him, and I want him to feel like I’m not going to stab him, but we’re almost to the mid game, and cross board alliances work a lot better than neighbor alliances once we get to the mid-game, so I think you can be confident that you’re the long-term ally I want.[SEP]A:That said, I’m definitely saying nice things to Austria too. I won’t deny that. Not the same nice things, but I can’t have Austria thinking I will attack him. That doesn’t help me and I don’t think it helps you.[SEP]B:All of that makes sense. I won&#x27;t call out Austria. How do you plan to continue your attack on France this year?[SEP]A:I don’t know. Is there something you’d like me to do? I’m rather flexible. I’d just really like to bust through for a build this year.[SEP]A:Thoughts?[SEP]A:Would you like to support me to MAO?[SEP]B:Won&#x27;t France just cut in Bre?[SEP]B:I&#x27;d actually like MAO next year.[SEP]B:I&#x27;d like to hear something about your plans before midnight[SEP]A:What do you need to know? I won’t move to MAO, I’ll try for Spain or Marseilles. Do you want to know more than that?[SEP]B:Have you been talking to France at all?[SEP]A:Nope. Not a word this phase.[SEP]B:Huh. I guess France is lying to me then?[SEP]A:Yes. I haven’t said a word to him. What’s he saying?[SEP]A:France is a snake.[SEP]B:Umm that you&#x27;re the highest ranked online player in the world. And that you consistently encouraged him to attack me.[SEP]A:Well that’s fun. Um, where to begin? \\n\\nI think I’m a good online player. I’ve been playing online for about two years. I have a site ranking on one website in the Top 100, and I have a site ranking on another website in the top 250. So, maybe if you combine those rankings and squint, I’d be in the top 200 or so?[SEP]A:Also, I don’t know who France is. So, he either has me confused with someone, or else he’s just trying to scare you. Let’s see...why would he be trying to scare you?[SEP]A:And, I have definitely encouraged him to attack you, as I recall, but it’s been several game years since then. I feel like you’ve probably encouraged France to attack me before (a fairly natural thing for England to do).[SEP]A:Bottom line: France has every reason in the world to try to get us to distrust each other, and he’s obviously willing to say whatever to make that happen.[SEP]A:I think I’ve been really honest with you, and I think we’ve been helpful to each other, and I think we are both going to succeed in this game if we can stick together and not give in to his tricks.[SEP]A:Cause snakes are gunna snake.[SEP]A:🐍 🐍 🐍 🐍 🐍[SEP]B:All of this pretty much lines up with what I expected, though it’s nice to hear from you. He says that you’re “[redacted]” on playdiplomacy.com . So I guess the user name lining up is just a coincidence. Not that I really care that much btw, but it would be interesting if you were secretly a star player.[SEP]A:I’ve never played on playdiplomacy. I play mostly on an app called Conspiracy. \\n\\nBut don’t get me wrong! I’m experienced, and I’ve had some success. I’m not to be trifled with![SEP]A:Also, you should be able to see from my moves, and Austria’s, that I’ve been telling you the truth.[SEP]B:Yeah, that&#x27;s fair. France is funny. I&#x27;ve gotten maybe 15 messages from France since I ghosted him. Is it rock, paper, or scissors against him this season?[SEP]B:From France: &quot;I can stop Italy this turn by the way. It&#x27;s pretty easy since Italy let me into Marseilles, I can support the hold in Marseilles and Marseilles can support MAO to Spain SC. It&#x27;s impossible to breach, I&#x27;ve checked it, and I can keep making those orders for years and years. You stabbed me in Spring 03. It is Fall 05. I think that you, Italy, and Germany are highly underestimating my ability to survive against your onslaught. You sure this is the game you want? Slowly whittling away at me until I die? Instead, I propose that we let you into the Mid Atlantic Ocean and that you help me defend Italy. I can send you past the MAO into West Med, where you can start taking dots like Tunis or Naples. We wait until AI crumbles, and you have an excellent game where you top the board.&quot;[SEP]B:So I have my interpretation of the message, but I&#x27;m curious to hear yours[SEP]A:Hmmm, thanks for sending that. I mean, obviously the orders he proposes can be defeated by tapping Marseilles and supporting into Spain. He knows we know that. He’s just playing games and trying to throw us off.[SEP]B:Yeah. Maybe it&#x27;s not even worth thinking about. It&#x27;s like the Sicilian in princess bride[SEP]A:Exactly[SEP]A:I’m just going to flip a coin.[SEP]B:So I guess you won&#x27;t go for MAO then?[SEP]A:Correct.[SEP]B:(also, there&#x27;s a couple other points I&#x27;d like to cover while I have you here)[SEP]B:Ok that sounds good. I&#x27;m eyeing that for next spring.[SEP]A:Sure.[SEP]B:Well, I&#x27;m surprised you haven&#x27;t been opinionated at all about my actions in Russia.[SEP]A:Hmmm, well, I do have opinions. I just don’t want to be overbearing.[SEP]A:What are you thinking over there?[SEP]B:The builds are tempting, but I don&#x27;t want to be the one that hands austria the game[SEP]B:What are your opinions?[SEP]B:I&#x27;m going to bed. But other things I want to talk about are 1) the anti-English moves from Germany, 2) what you&#x27;re doing with the Tyr unit.[SEP]A:Responding now.[SEP]A:You are thinking about the right considerations re Russia/Austria. Every build is enticing, but you have to consider the cost. Right now, Russia is basically using all of his units to help you. So, I think you might be better off foregoing that build and keeping Russia on your side for now.[SEP]A:But...I certainly have no horse in that fight.[SEP]A:If you want to attack Russia, no need to hold back on my account.[SEP]A:I do want you to grow so that you and I are the same size. And those Russian centers will be key to that. But they also aren’t going anywhere. I don’t think there is any rush, personally.[SEP]A:The Russian units are doing things you want them to do right now.[SEP]A:Re Germany, I hadn’t really noticed the anti-English moves. She keeps telling me that y’all are very close.[SEP]A:I feel pretty confident that she’s with you, and that she really wants to see France out of the game.[SEP]A:Re Tyrolia, what would you like me to do? I do have a plan with that unit. And if you wanted to deal a blow to Austria, I can think of at least one devious plan to make his turn go poorly.[SEP]B:All that makes sense and I believe it. I feel like your &quot;horse&quot; in the russian front is Austria&#x27;s future strength, which could pose a threat to you. Your advice to me is consistent with that.[SEP]A:Yeah, that’s true. I just don’t want to be too nosy or high maintenance, really.[SEP]A:I could see you feeling like you need to get some builds promptly, and so you pick off a Russian unit or two. Even though that may make my situation tougher, I feel like your cooperation against France and later Germany means too much to me for me to try to dictate what you do with Russia.[SEP]A:I hope that makes sense.[SEP]A:But my advice about what you should do really is my opinion about the best way to approach it from your perspective. I don’t think you need to be in a hurry there. I think that just about every place on the board is moving in a positive direction for you right now, and so, if I were you, I would not want to shake that up.[SEP]A:But if you do want to do that, it’s very much okay with me.[SEP]B:Yeah I&#x27;m not going for Russia right now. Supposing he can hold the stalemate, he&#x27;s literally just saving those territories for me to take at a later date. I will get a little annoyed if the admin cuts us off at 1910 though, as I think my endgame is a little past that.[SEP]B:The anti-english moves aren&#x27;t strictly anti-english. But a fleet build in Berlin and then moving to Kie is a little aggressive. Germany hoped I would just give up denmark this fall, and that was her explanation of the kie move. Eventually that Kie fleet will be going against me. A stab right now from germany doesn&#x27;t seem to make much sense though.[SEP]B:It would have to be coordinated with france to even have a chance, and with the pressure you&#x27;re putting in the south I don&#x27;t know how France could afford that. Unless he&#x27;s really pissed at me and goes for a kamikaze just to annoy me.[SEP]B:And what devious thing could you do with Tyr that wouldn&#x27;t immediately begin aggressions with austria?[SEP]B:Ok now I&#x27;m really going to bed. But I can think of a Tyr move that would really stir up some trouble. I wonder if we&#x27;re thinking of the same one.[SEP]A:Any chance you are around this morning?[SEP]B:What’s up?[SEP]A:I don’t want to tell Russia a way to deal Austria a blow because Russia will turn around and tell Austria. But I trust you, so I think I could pass on some info to you and you might not use it against me.[SEP]B:Gotcha. What are the moves you’re thinking?[SEP]A:You might say something like this to Russia:\\n\\nI was chatting with Italy about Tyrolia, and he told me that he promised to use Tyrolia to help Austria. My best guess is that Tyrolia and Galicia will bounce in Vienna. If you just use Bohemia to support Tyrolia in, then Austria doesn’t get a build and you likely break up Italy and Austria.[SEP]A:Too devious? 🤭🤫[SEP]B:I&#x27;d considered this move as something that russia could do to free up Gal, but I think I thought Ser was a home center or something, so I didn&#x27;t realize the build consequence.[SEP]B:I&#x27;d bet russia is already planning to do this, but I can make the suggestion[SEP]B:I did have a different move for Tyr in mind.[SEP]A:Oh yeah?[SEP]B:This is not a good idea, i should clarify. But it would be very dramatic if you successfully supported Boh to Mun[SEP]B:(also I have a feeling russia won&#x27;t be online before noon unfortunately)[SEP]B:well, russia had the right idea, but didn&#x27;t choose the right one to support. Bounce in Ank planned? And congrats on Mar[SEP]A:Yes, both bounces planned. Russia made a nice gamble taking Bulgaria.[SEP]B:Even with Austria in BLA now? I&#x27;ll be a little annoyed if I see a build in St. P[SEP]A:Yeah, for sure. Austria loses that build and keeps Vienna vacant. Russia GETS a build. Yeah, I think that worked well for Russia.[SEP]B:We should start talking about the France endgame and what things look like post-war. Maybe after we see the French choice for a disband. I think France hates me the most (despite me having taken none of his territories) and as a result will probably hold onto Brest until the end, or maybe even go for LVP or something.[SEP]A:Sure — I’m happy to talk it through. That move by France to bounce NAO was annoying.[SEP]B:Yeah, I kinda saw that coming. So things are kinda escalating with germany. She’s making lots of asks that I don’t think are reasonable. Like “why not just give me denmark” and “why not just leave Nth open”. She’s also admitted to being friendly with France.[SEP]A:Yeah, I’m hearing rumblings of the same thing from Germany. Just sort of feeling me out on whether I’d be okay with her working with France. Not good.[SEP]A:How would you like to address it with moves this turn? Do you want me to support you to MAO? Or should I move there?[SEP]B:How has she suggested to you that she’ll be helping France? Because if she’s telling you that, it must mean working with france against me, maybe with something specific in mind. She also wants me to give up Brest haha. Maybe i’ll ask if she wants London[SEP]A:I don’t know anything specific. She’s just asking for my thoughts. I have not responded.[SEP]A:Though, I’m not surprised. France is not going to quit. He hasn’t been talking to me anymore and he hasn’t been trying to turn you. That means he’s been working on Germany. I think we just have to keep telling her that France is a Dark Wizard who does not have her best interest in mind.[SEP]B:Yeah, I mean good on France for being persistent. I&#x27;m sure France is telling her that we&#x27;re allies. And that would actually be the truth. And just geographically it would be hard for me and germany to be allies longer-term, so it&#x27;s somewhat understandable that Germany could be swayed by that logic.[SEP]B:What are your thoughts on the timing of war with Germany (if you&#x27;re keen on a war in the near future at all)? I have an idea of how to handle the situation that&#x27;s slightly dependent on that[SEP]A:Well, I don’t really want to attack Germany this year. In a perfect world, you and I each get a build this year, and we are in position to attack Germany next year.[SEP]A:Germany seems to like my advice, so I may be able to get her to take Paris this year and refrain from attacking you. If we can cripple France in the next two turns, without Germany attacking, then next year’s attack on Germany would be easy.[SEP]A:That is my general thinking in it.[SEP]B:I mean I don&#x27;t see how I get a build this year outside of moving in on Russia, but I&#x27;d rather stay out for now. Honestly the worst that Germany can do this year is knock me out of the channel.[SEP]B:So I don&#x27;t want support into MAO this turn. I might reach out to France with a proposition for survival that I won&#x27;t follow through with. But maybe I can make it convincing enough that he gives it a shot. Otherwise I&#x27;m rather nervous that France gives Germany a big hand with attacking my island in his final years[SEP]B:Also, will an attack on Germany really be easy next year?[SEP]B:Also, did you tell germany i was plotting against her? She says you did.[SEP]A:Whoa — no, I want you and Germany to work together.[SEP]A:I would not and have not said you are plotting against her. She floated the “work with France thing,” and I suggested that she should really take Paris now while she can.[SEP]A:If we can get Germany to take Paris, next year will be much easier. I think we should both direct her there.[SEP]B:You really said nothing to that effect? What would prompt france to say that to me? It’s ok if you did say something, but i want you to be honest about it.[SEP]B:Some exciting moves. Will be curious to see where you stand.[SEP]A:Hey — sorry I’ve been offline since the bot went down. That looks like a pretty aggressive move from Germany. I wonder if France has pocketed her. I do like the move to Paris, but the rest is not good.[SEP]B:Yeahh. It’s a shame. I mean i’m aware at this point that the two of you could choose to mow over me. I hope the expanse in northern russia makes you wary of helping germany though.[SEP]B:Time for survival mode. Will appreciate some advice on tactics if you’re on my side of this.[SEP]A:Yeah, I’m on your side. I’ll help on tactics, but I think the real key here is getting Germany to flip back. I don’t see why that move has to be permanent. I think you should tell her something like this: “Look, I see that you are attacking you, but I think it’s my fault not yours. I should have given you back Denmark. I see that now. And I’m sorry. I will move out peaceably, and I hope we can work out a new working relationship.”[SEP]A:Just say you’re sorry. She can take it back anyway, might as well offer it back right?[SEP]A:(And I’m not saying you have anything to be sorry for, I’m just trying to brainstorm about what will help you turn her back to your side.)[SEP]B:I already responded non-angrily, though not specifically what you said. I think a return of denmark could go a long way. Though that border will make things tense, and i don’t think peace with her could last forever[SEP]B:One thing I&#x27;m curious about: Why would you want Germany and I to be friends? Aren&#x27;t you better off with both of us fighting? And I can keep Denmark this fall if I give up the channel (which may fall anyways)[SEP]A:Well, I want to be rid of France. I’ve really been depending on the two of you to help in that project. If England decides to move out of Paris for France, that’s bad for me. \\n\\nAlso, I don’t want to see Germany get two builds this turn. But you’re right, if it’s inevitable anyway, it’s not the end of the world. \\n\\n#teamengland[SEP]B:I sure hope you’ve not been clicking that thumbs down haha. It would be a brutal stab. I suppose i’ve got to place my trust somewhere though. Why choose me instead of germany?[SEP]B:You know, if you&#x27;re able to lend a hand from MAO, I&#x27;m actually not in THAT bad of shape. Can I depend on that?[SEP]A:1) You’ve been straight with me all game. 2) You have a much better ability to read the board than she does. 3) You’re on the other side, so you can’t really stab me, but I could totally see her moving to Tyrolia some time soon. 4) You’re not in France’s pocket.[SEP]B:All good reasons. Also, I think Germany is gonna ghost me, soooo, friends? I need MAO to attack Bre. Can you do that?[SEP]A:I will ensure that Brest can’t hurt you. Not sure yet if I’ll cut that support or get France to do something weird with it, but you can consider that unit non functional this turn. I’ll also see what intel I can gain.[SEP]B:Cool. You really think you can get france to take your advice on Brest?[SEP]B:And do you have opinions about russia walking into Mun?[SEP]A:Re Brest: if I’m not confident, I’ll just cut that support. I know that one is important to you, and I’ll make sure it’s taken care of.[SEP]A:Re Munich: that one never really crossed my mind. But if you can get Russia to do that, it would be awesome. I don’t want to see Germany get builds here.[SEP]B:Cool. Any advice on the rest of tactics for my defense? I have my own ideas, but would be curious to hear your opinion[SEP]A:I’d probably just use the army to protect Liverpool. I’d send NAO to Norwegian if the battle is going to be against Germany. And I’d flip a coin between supporting Channel to Belgium or supporting Denmark holding.[SEP]A:And I wouldn’t tell anyone the result of that coin flip. There is just no reason to share that info.[SEP]B:Huh. That&#x27;s way different than what I had in mind.[SEP]A:Well, you’re closer to it than I am. I’m sure you’ve taken a much harder look. What am I missing?[SEP]B:You&#x27;re not missing anything, but I had a more defensive strategy in mind I guess. I&#x27;ve got some time to think it over. Please do let me know what intel you receive[SEP]B:Hi, I have a different ask of the MAO unit actually, if you&#x27;re around this morning.[SEP]A:Hey — what’s up?[SEP]B:I want to see whether supporting channel to Bre is an option for MAO you&#x27;d consider. And I&#x27;d also want to know if Gas support will be cut.[SEP]A:Well, have to just be honest here — I’ve been working on a larger plan considering your earlier request that I neutralize Brest, and I’m not sure that change works in the larger scheme.[SEP]A:More broadly, is there any chance you’d like to form a trio and work with me and Russia long term?[SEP]B:Why wouldn&#x27;t you let me in on your larger plan?[SEP]B:And does your larger plan include neutralizing Brest, or did it just consider that I asked that? Can you confirm you&#x27;re neutralizing Brest by attacking it from MAO?[SEP]A:Yes, hitting Brest. \\n\\nI prefer not to share my moves if they don’t matter to someone else. There is just less chance that something goes wrong, and less chance I end up blaming someone else if something goes wrong.[SEP]A:What do you think about E/I/R as a trio?[SEP]B:I think you need to justify to me why supporting into Brest isn&#x27;t an option. I don&#x27;t see how this could be relevant to some larger plan. Unless the plan is &quot;don&#x27;t give England that build, don&#x27;t show others that I&#x27;m supporting England&quot;[SEP]A:Wow. Well, you asked me to do something else earlier, and I have spent days trying to fit your earlier request into my move set.[SEP]A:But, you know what, it’s more important to me to have you as an ally. So I’ll support you to Brest.[SEP]B:I obviously would like that. But to be honest I care less about the support and more about the secret.[SEP]A:So, confirmed, MAO supporting Channel to Brest.[SEP]A:Test.[SEP]A:It’s not a secret. It’s just that I like to keep my moves secret unless they matter to someone.[SEP]B:Can you confirm whether support from Gas is cut as well?[SEP]A:I am not currently cutting support in Gascony.[SEP]B:Ok. And I&#x27;m down to chat about russian relations after the move. Sorry for the last-minute change here. But germany&#x27;s been putting pressure on me[SEP]A:Have to say — I expect Germany to use Paris to support Brest. Those two seem to be in lockstep now.[SEP]A:Are you sure that I should just take Portugal to drop England down to 1 unit?[SEP]A:I mean drop France down to 1 unit.[SEP]B:France is just going to bounce you out, right? What else does it make sense for the Spa unit to do?[SEP]A:He thinks I am supporting an attack on Spain and moving to Burgundy, so I think his moves look like this:\\n\\nSpain hold\\nGas S Spa holding\\nParis S Brest\\nBrest S MAO - Channel (he asked me to take it)\\nIrish - Liv[SEP]B:Hmm, yeah I would have thought he would assume the Gas support would be cut. Does France really hate you the least?[SEP]A:Yeah, I think France trusts that I’m actually going to Channel and Burgundy here.[SEP]B:I will admit I&#x27;ve communicated with Germany about your plan to use MAO to help me. That may have made its way back to France[SEP]A:I feel like you, Germany, and France: if I tell anyone anything, it circulates to all three.[SEP]B:Yeahh. I maybe should keep my mouth shut more often.[SEP]A:Germany says that the Brest thing relates to Denmark. \\n\\nAnyway, what should we do?[SEP]B:It does. I&#x27;m giving up denmark for support to Brest.[SEP]A:Okay, I’ll support you to Brest.[SEP]B:Sounds great[SEP]B:Thanks[SEP]B:Glad to see that go through.[SEP]B:Told you about the move to Por btw[SEP]A:You were right. Thank you.[SEP]B:Well I&#x27;m glad to see the takedown work out. I suppose France has one more unit, but Por will fall next year. And now things get even more interesting. Signing off for now.[SEP]A:Hmmm, interesting French disband. He wants me to support him to Brest. Have to believe he’s going to have Germany on his side given the German fleet build. \\n\\nThoughts on how to approach this? We should be able to defeat them if we stick together.[SEP]A:I think we should focus on getting your army to Pic this turn, and I can support you to Paris in the Fall.[SEP]A:DO NOT DISCUSS PLANS WITH GERMANY THIS TURN. Seems very clear that she’s coming for you based on the build and the French disband. I don’t think we help ourselves by speaking with her. Let’s just get you into Paris, secure North Sea, and get moving.[SEP]A:I don’t need any builds in the North. If I get bigger, I’ll have a target on my back. So I’m just going to help you get up to my level.[SEP]A:Also, I need to decide to work with Russia or Austria in the East. What’s your preference?[SEP]B:I&#x27;ll be in communication with Germany, but I&#x27;ll agree to not share any specific plans discussed between the two of us this turn. Is that fair?[SEP]A:Yes of course. I don’t mean that you shouldn’t talk to her at all.[SEP]B:At first glance, I prefer an alliance with Russia, though I understand this means you breaking a relationship with Austria. Mostly this is because Russia can threaten me if he ever goes north. What&#x27;s your preference?[SEP]A:Well, that’s fine with me. I like Russia. But here is the downside for you: if Russia grows, the north won’t be undefended any more, and you will have less room to grow. So, think long term, and think about where your dots are going to come from. I mean it sincerely when I say that I’ll join up with either one provided you feel good about it, but I actually think it might be better for you if I give back Austria a couple of centers and position you to grab Swe and STP once Germany is on her heels.[SEP]B:Those are good points. I suppose you&#x27;d like to commit to this before moves this evening?[SEP]B:*commit one way or the other[SEP]A:Yeah, I think we should make a plan.[SEP]A:I’d like to have your final thoughts on A/R as quickly as possible so that I have time to execute a plan. But I understand if you want time to think about it.[SEP]A:How is Germany treating you right now? Did she tell you about that fleet build before it happened? Seems like a bad sign, and North Sea is awfully exposed.[SEP]B:Oh she told me that she plans to line the whole northwest coast with fleets because &quot;they&#x27;re more versatile there&quot;. But all they can do from the northwest coast is invade me.[SEP]B:She also said she wants Brest eventually.[SEP]B:Not sure if I can keep Nth this year. We&#x27;ll see if I can keep it friendly. That involves lots of talk about moving against you. She wants to see me in MAO.[SEP]A:Yeah, look, I don’t mind if you tell her that you’re moving against me. I am telling her that I’m moving against you. \\n\\nLet’s please make the following deal: You and I both plot with Germany as if we’re attacking each other. And we both share the plan with Germany against the other guy with each other, and we pledge to tell Germany (and France if he asks) that you and I are not talking much, we don’t trust each other, and we don’t have any plan in place.[SEP]A:This turn will work best if we share all info that we learn from G/F, and we pledge to keep our own talks secret.[SEP]A:I think that we can pull off a great turn, but it won’t work if G/F get catch wind of our alliance.[SEP]B:All that makes sense. I&#x27;m on board. You know, if Germany just stopped surprising me with aggressive moves, she may have won my favor. [sigh][SEP]B:And I think Austria is the ally we choose. If we hold off Germany, she can only expand into Russia, which would be her only friend. And the trusting relationship you have makes it more likely that things will go through.[SEP]A:👌[SEP]A:So, here is the plan that Germany is telling me:\\n\\nShe wants to ensure she gets North Sea. So she is asking for this:\\n\\nDen S Bel - North\\nBel - North\\nHol - Bel\\nPic - Channel\\nSpa - Gas\\nPar S Sap - Gas\\nMAO - Irish[SEP]A:She wanted me to support her direct from Paris to Brest, but I convinced her that you would likely fear a forced disband, so you were likely to try to keep me out of Gascony (thus Par S Spa - Gas).[SEP]A:I don’t think we can save North Sea this turn, but if we can land your army in Pic, we can force France to retreat to Belgium, which would be absolutely awesome. And I think his survival instinct would kick in at that point, and he would stay there until you take it.[SEP]B:I may be able to save Nth with some diplomacy. Is it worth me trying to make Germany a hard case to be on my side? Does that just make her moves less predictable?[SEP]A:So I would suggest this:\\nBre S Wal - Pic\\nWal - Pic\\nChannel Convoy Wal - Pic\\n\\nThat means Germany will lose Paris and Belgium this year. And I think you can defend your territory even with G in North Sea.[SEP]A:I really think that we are best off not suggesting that you and I are talking. If Germany gets any idea that I shared her plans with you, we’ll have no idea what they are going to do.[SEP]B:Uhh, Germany will just hop into one of my home centers from Nth in the fall...[SEP]A:I trust you at this point, but I don’t think that confronting her is the best move here.[SEP]A:No, you can defend.[SEP]B:Oh move to Cly?[SEP]B:Oh wait Nth just retreats. whoops[SEP]A:You can move NAO to Norwegian in Spring, and retreat North to Norway. Then in Fall you cover London with Channel while I support you to Paris.[SEP]A:Right.[SEP]A:So you have coverage for every center, and you get the build, while G loses two.[SEP]B:Thoughts on a retreat to Hel?[SEP]A:That’s the best I can come up with if G is being honest with me.[SEP]A:I would not be opposed to a retreat to Hel, but it depends a lot on what the board looks like. I’m not crazy about Germany taking Norway. We want her taking units off the board.[SEP]B:Well I&#x27;ll at least communicate with Germany to the point that she thinks I&#x27;m genuinely against you. But I won&#x27;t ask for any favors.[SEP]B:If I do I&#x27;ll let you know, and we should expect that you hear about them.[SEP]A:Agreed. Yes, I’m totally fine with that. We want G thinking that we’re working against each other.[SEP]A:And, frankly, she’s going to be pissed at me after this move, so I wouldn’t mind if you lied to her too at the same time to spread that out a bit.[SEP]A:So plot away against me, but tell me what plan you guys work out, so we can talk about what she’s most likely to do.[SEP]B:France wants me to go for MAO. I&#x27;m going to say I&#x27;m on board with that. I&#x27;ll say NAO is going there.[SEP]B:I mean germany[SEP]A:Yep. That makes sense. She wants Edi and Norway clear.[SEP]B:Also, does it matter so much if Germany is mad at both of us? Isn&#x27;t it basically war in the Fall?[SEP]A:If I were you, I’d order NAO to Norwegian. From Norwegian, you have a play to defend Norway AND Edi. Which means you could retreat to Helg if you like and you have a 50/50 to defend Norway or Edi.[SEP]B:Yeah that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll order[SEP]A:Re G being mad: it’s not the end of the world. I mean, we’ll definitely be at war with her. I just don’t want her trying to throw the game in spite or anything like that. Cause I am lying to her like crazy this turn. 🤭🤫[SEP]B:yeahh... it happens. i&#x27;ve been fortunate to not really have to lie so far.[SEP]B:What are your thoughts on Mun?[SEP]B:Also, just out of curiosity, did you advise Germany to build the Kiel fleet?[SEP]A:I absolutely did not advise G to build the F Kie.[SEP]A:We did not talk at all about that build.[SEP]A:Thoughts on Mun? What do you mean?[SEP]A:If G would have asked, I would have said that two armies would make me a bit uncomfortable, but I would not have insisted on a fleet, as two armies would have been more anti-Russian than anything. But she did not ask me.[SEP]B:I believe you. I just was curious. And I didn&#x27;t look closely enough at Mun. Ber can just support. But I thought it might be interesting to work with Russia there, even if Russia isn&#x27;t the long-term ally.[SEP]B:Also, who does germany think the third ally is?[SEP]B:I ask because we may be interested to know whether Germany will try to sneak into Swe or not.[SEP]A:Well, I’m not next to Munich now, so there isn’t much I can do about that. Maybe in the Fall.[SEP]A:Germany and I have not discussed a third ally. She doesn’t give the impression that she cares much about the east.[SEP]B:I guess the question in spring is whether you move to Tyr. And would we want her moving into Russia? If she goes east and annoys her future only friend on the board, this might complicate their future relations.[SEP]A:Well, that’s a great idea. I am all for her moving on Russia if you can accomplish that. I’m certainly willing to go to Tyrolia.[SEP]B:Alright. I&#x27;ll plant the seed about anti-russia stuff. If she thinks you&#x27;re a friend, though, she may listen to you more than me.[SEP]A:FYI, she just asked me if I am talking with you. I told her: “I am wary of England right now. He just asked me what I want to do this turn. I feel like he’s trying to get me to leave MAO open.”[SEP]B:Cool. consistent with my messaging. I&#x27;m talking about a plan to leave Bre open and get her support to Gas so I can support into Spa. I&#x27;m asking for her to promise Bre to France and then bounce in Bre instead.[SEP]B:Then I&#x27;d dislodge in MAO and you&#x27;d retreat to IRI. We&#x27;ll see what she thinks. I imagine she&#x27;s just playing along, But I need to make specific plans to be believable[SEP]A:💯[SEP]B:Looks like germany is staying friendly with russia. Can we go over moves one more time so i can be sure we’re on the same page?[SEP]A:Here is what I have down right now:\\nMAO S Brest\\nWES S MAO\\nLYO - TYR S\\nSpa - Gas\\nPie - Mar\\nVen - Tyr\\nNap - ION[SEP]B:Cool. All expected. Right now I&#x27;m:\\nNAO to NWG\\nNTH hold\\nWal to Pic\\nChannel convoy wal to pic\\nBre support Wal to Pic[SEP]A:I like it. \\n\\nAs I think about it more, you may be better off moving North to Holland, expecting a bounce there. I think you’re slightly better off keeping the German fleet in Kiel, as it’s one less German unit in North Sea, but it’s not a huge difference either way.[SEP]B:That&#x27;s good advice. I&#x27;ll take it[SEP]A:I’m kind of excited about this turn.[SEP]B:A stab is always exciting[SEP]A:I’m sorry mate. You’ve been a terrific ally. First class all the way. But on this turn, Germany made the kind of offer I could not refuse, and so I went for it.[SEP]A:I know that doesn’t make it any easier, but I really mean it when I say that you’ve played a strong game, and been an excellent ally.[SEP]B:No worries, nicely played on your end. I think I can top Germany’s offer if you’re interested. Let me know![SEP]A:Hmmmm...I’m intrigued. Aren’t you supposed to be screaming obscenities at me right now?This response is downright classy and sportsmanlike.[SEP]B:Haha yeah I suppose. But this game for me is about learning. I’m relatively new to the game, and I volunteered for the study 1) to help out my friend, and 2) to prep for an in-person game I have on August 11. So if I get the right experience from this game and do well in the in-person game (i.e. win bragging rights among my friends), I’ve won MY game. Here is my offer: You bring me along to second place, I vow to help you solo as Italy, and you teach me how you pulled it off. What do you say?[SEP]A:Well that is a better offer than Germany’s. One of the best offers I’ve ever received. And I really mean it when I say that you’re a joy to play with and a strong ally. I’d be happy to teach you as much as I can.[SEP]A:I suggest you retreat to Skagerrak to put maximum pressure on Germany.[SEP]B:Well i’m happy to learn if you’re willing to teach. Do we have a deal then? This is obviously something you’ll have to trust me with. But I haven’t lied tp you yet and don’t intend to. And i imagine you can tactically keep me in a position where i’m not a threat. Also, on the teaching side of things I may have some questions about earlier in the game to learn how you set things up (and I would expect genuine answers!)[SEP]B:And yeah, that retreat makes sense. You think norway and the home island are too defensive?[SEP]A:I’ll answer anything you ask honestly.[SEP]A:You have more options from Skag, and she can’t cover them all. You have a much higher upside from there, and it might be worth it for you to take Sweden to avoid having to disband.[SEP]A:Regarding your offer: it may be hard to put you in second place, frankly. If your units are doing things that help me, then I’ll try to keep your units on the board, and I definitely won’t allow you to be eliminated, but it’s really hard for me to ensure that you place second.[SEP]B:I can settle for survival. Deal.[SEP]B:Your reasoning on Skag makes sense. Going to bed now. First question on strategy is: how frequently dp you tell lies, and what are the typical circumstances?[SEP]A:Hmmm, well, you know, we’ll have statistics to help answer that question at the end of the game. I’d say that I am mostly honest, and I place a lot of value on my credibility. I’m not going to lie about my moves to someone unless I am going to get a huge advantage out of it. But I spend most of the game trying to make everyone else on the board feel that I’m their closest ally, so a lot of what I say is a shade on the truth.[SEP]A:So, I found it hard to decide whether to use a thumbs up or thumbs down quite a lot. Most of the time, there is some truth in what I’m saying, but I am trying to persuade the other player to do something for reasons I am not telling them.[SEP]A:So, in general, I’m not afraid to lie, but I am very afraid of getting caught lying. I try to preserve my credibility as best I can, but if I am setting up a stab, I will tell some serious whoppers.[SEP]A:Also, that thing France said about my past successes: that was true. I do have a lot of experience and I have had a fair amount of success playing online diplomacy. I just did not want you thinking of me that way.[SEP]A:I’ll also note, just cause I have nobody else to talk with about this: I worked REALLY hard on this last move. Germany wanted to take Brest, but if that happened, it would have cut support and prevented your army from leaving your island. So I had to convince Germany to support France to Brest, without telling her the real reason why. And I needed you to go to NAO so that you could not guard Liverpool. There were so many lies!🤞😱[SEP]A:And that doesn’t even include the East![SEP]A:To be completely honest, I directed just about everyone else’s moves on that turn! Russia is the one exception, but I basically knew what he was going to do. The best advice I have for someone who wants to get better at Diplomacy: just work hard. You can win by putting in more time and effort than everyone else. I have success by writing a lot to everyone all the time.[SEP]B:Yeah that’s one thing about online diplomacy I have mixed feelings about. It seems like there’s definitely a benefit from putting a lot of time in. I feel like I’ve been putting a lot of time in as it is, but there’s been the temptation to put in more. For in-person everybody gets the same amount of time to chat, which can be an equalizer in some ways.[SEP]B:I had considered what a stab from you might look like before it happened, and I was like “is he really going to all that trouble” but I suppose you were. Care to share why you chose Germany and how early you made that choice? What was the “offer”?[SEP]B:And that’s cool that i’m playing with a champ![SEP]A:Hi England — so I see that you retreated to Norway. Not what I expected, but it can work. Would you still like to work with me?[SEP]B:Yeah i know we didn’t chat about this. It was a little last minute, and you hadn’t responded in the morning so I didn’t think you were around (also I thought Ska was more a suggestion). I should have given you a heads up. My thinking was 1) it’s going to Sweden anyways, 2) i thought it might help warm relations with germany. Was this a bad call?[SEP]B:I would still like to work with you[SEP]A:Not a big deal at all.[SEP]A:I suggest that you take Sweden, and I’m working on getting Belgium this turn too. It’ll be tricky to keep Germany from defending it, but I’m going to try.[SEP]B:Pic to Bel?[SEP]B:And you were a bit shy about the earlier learning question. I guess it may be something sensitive to give an honest answer to at this time. One other question I have is whether there&#x27;s a mistake you&#x27;ve seen in my play that you think I could have done differently. Like choosing to cold-shoulder France or choosing not to sneak into Sweden earlier.[SEP]B:Also, France is asking about our relations after the stab. What would you like me to say?[SEP]A:Something about how awful I am and how much you want revenge?🤭[SEP]B:Haha alright. I’ll keep you “aBrest” of how France will move that fleet (should he choose to share)[SEP]A:Okay, I think we have a good move brewing![SEP]A:If you’re sincerely on board, this will be fun![SEP]A:France is ordering Brest to Channel. \\nGermany is ordering Burg S Bel and convoying Holland to Yorkshire....![SEP]A:So here is the move:\\nNorway - Swe\\nPic S Channel - Belgium\\nMar - Bur to cut support\\nGas to Bre to block the Paris move. \\n\\nI think you’re going to get a build this turn even if I take Liverpool. \\n\\nDoes that make sense?[SEP]B:Yeah I&#x27;m on board, though I will remind you that you&#x27;re forgetting an important part of the bargain. So I guess NWG to Edi (which is probably safe in case she goes for the build instead) and then plan to build in London?[SEP]A:What part of the bargain am I forgetting? It’s unintentional. I’m trying to be helpful![SEP]B:You overlooked a couple of my questions.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve been busy setting up that move, so it&#x27;s no big deal, just wanted to remind you[SEP]A:Sorry.[SEP]A:You asked a question about what Germany offered me. Do you mind if I answer that after this move? I’d just like to see for sure that you’re sincere in working with me after I so rudely stabbed you.[SEP]B:Yeah that one&#x27;s fair to skip for now I think.[SEP]A:Germany is now fishing for info from me about our relationship. Does she know that we are still talking? I’d like to tell her that you’re mad at me and you will tell me nothing, but we must keep our stories straight.[SEP]B:No, but I&#x27;d bet she&#x27;d assume it. We didn&#x27;t have much to say to each other this morning. I tried to be friendly but she was kinda straight up about saying that an alliance wasn&#x27;t going to work out. And I sent a message back but haven&#x27;t heard anything. So I&#x27;d imagine she&#x27;d think I&#x27;m not just sitting here twiddling my thumbs. Up to you how to spin it though.[SEP]A:Thank you. 👌[SEP]B:I&#x27;m going to be hit or miss with connectivity this evening, so I&#x27;m putting moves in now. Will look just before the adjudication though. But I&#x27;m trying to get some work done. So right now I&#x27;m: Eng to Bel, Pic support Eng to Bel, Nwy to Swe, and NWG to Edi.[SEP]A:👍[SEP]A:I’ll let you know if anything changes on my end.[SEP]B:Cool, sounds good[SEP]A:Hmmm, Germany is backing off the bait. I think we will have to change our plan.[SEP]B:What&#x27;s up?[SEP]A:Not sure yet, but she is not going to leave Belgium unguarded so that won’t work.[SEP]B:Alright, keep me posted.[SEP]A:She is pressing hard now for info from me on your moves. I am telling her that you are jovial with me, but that we have not discussed any substance.[SEP]B:👍[SEP]B:France is offering to move in a way that would help against you. Does it matter what I say?[SEP]A:I don’t think it matters. I believe he is lying to you.[SEP]B:Okay. Cause you had said he’d be going to the channel before. Is that still true? And any update on belgium?[SEP]A:Working on it. I’ll have an update in an hour.[SEP]B:Ok. I’ll be asleep probably, but i’ll see in the morning.[SEP]A:So, it sounds to me like Germany thinks you are coming for her and she will not leave Belgium unguarded. \\n\\nI think your best bet will be the following:\\nPicardy - Brest (expect a bounce)\\nChannel - London (expect that The French fleet will move to the Channel, which will mean you don’t lose Brest, \\nNorwegian to Edi (just in case)\\nNorway to Sweden\\n\\nI was hoping for a better move involving taking Belgium, but I just don’t think I can swing it. \\n\\nThoughts? What are you hearing now from France and Germany?[SEP]B:Long one from Germany. Talking up your evils, talking collaboration with France. Suggested moves are NWG to Cly, holland to york, eng goes to iri or wales, belgium supports brest to channel. Pic to bre, par to pic, bur to par, mun to bur.[SEP]B:Haven’t responded yet. Will have a somewhat busy morning, so i’ll appreciate your guidance if you think this changes anything[SEP]A:Thank you. Just woke up. Thinking about this. Any ideas?[SEP]A:Seems like she’s going to try to take Brest for herself.[SEP]A:I think you tell her “yes,” but then order Pic to Bre and Channel to London. That way France moves out of Brest, and you bounce Germany in Brest and keep it.[SEP]A:And I’d stick with NWG to Edi and Norway to Sweden.[SEP]A:And by the way: Thank you very much for filling me in. Makes me feel really confident that you’re with me.[SEP]B:Yeah, happy to help. Just got online now. Let me take a moment to process all of this.[SEP]B:Ok,first question: You&#x27;re saying she&#x27;s going for Bre on her own, but she&#x27;s suggesting Pic to Bre. Maybe she&#x27;s hoping for you to support Paris in?[SEP]A:Hmmm, no, she does not expect my support. But I’m surprised she’s screwing over France.[SEP]B:Well, do you think she&#x27;s being honest with me?[SEP]A:It’s really hard for me to say. I know she is eager for her own builds, so my best guess is that she’s being partially honest with you and that she is going to grab London or Edi if she feels confident you are not going to cover.[SEP]B:Yeah, the suggestion of going to Cly is consistent with that. And that the channel moves away from london[SEP]B:I think your suggestion makes sense. Covering Edi and London is safe, and Germany seems a bit unpredictable. And I keep fingers crossed that France indeed will vacate Brest[SEP]B:And, since you haven&#x27;t been specific on your plan for Lvp, I can only assume that you&#x27;ll be moving there.[SEP]A:I am planning to move to Liverpool. I’m sorry that costs you a unit. But the way this is going, it may very well be the last center I take from you, and I think it’s much more likely now that you take second place.[SEP]B:Ok gotcha. Hmm I just realized that I really have to hope for a bounce in Edi or London. Because If I get Bre and Swe, I would get a build even with you in Lvp, but then I wouldn&#x27;t have an open home supply center to build at[SEP]A:Well, you’re right about that. Perhaps ask Germany to bounce with you in Edi?[SEP]A:Though, I don’t think you’ll be getting a build now because you’re unlikely to get Belgium. But...if you think Germany is really convoying to Yorkshire, I’m willing to order Marseilles to Burgundy to cut support while you support Channel to Belgium.[SEP]B:If I get Bre and Swe, but you get Lvp, I&#x27;m still net up by one (it will be rebuilding the disbanded fleet that was in Bre).[SEP]A:Brest is already English.[SEP]B:Yeah. But I get the unit back is all I mean. I&#x27;m down to 4 now.[SEP]B:I have 5 centers and 4 units now. Add Swe, hold Bre, take away Lvp, and I&#x27;ve got another unit to put on the board[SEP]B:But only if I have a free home supply center[SEP]A:Ah, you’re totally right. My mistake.[SEP]A:This is getting tricky.[SEP]B:Haha yeah. Given your comms with France, would it make sense that she&#x27;s being genuine with me?[SEP]A:It’s possible. But I just don’t know.[SEP]A:I’d be really surprised if she wanted to cut out France at this point.[SEP]B:Yeah, I think I have to play defensive then. I actually think aggression from her is more likely. I would be surprised if neither london or edi bounce. I&#x27;ll say I agree to her proposal though.[SEP]A:Okay, I think that’s the right move. This is the first turn in a while that is fairly unpredictable from my point of view. It would be really great if you wind up with a build.[SEP]A:Well played.[SEP]A:So do I get ghosted now after you duped me?[SEP]A:If your strategy is not to talk to me again, I’d appreciate if you would at least let me know that, as a courtesy. Just trying to play a board game here.[SEP]B:Hey, no not going to be a dick. I have agreed to not talk to you.[SEP]A:Okay. I think that is a bad choice in any game of Diplomacy (and likely in any game in general), and it only helps other people. But I’ll respect your choice if that is how you want to play. \\n\\nIf you do ever decide you want to talk, my door will always be open, no matter what. And I am willing to keep all communications secret, if that’s the issue.[SEP]B:Love is a game. And it’s wise to stay away from your ex if the relationship was toxic[SEP]A:I mean...you encouraged me to go for the solo, and then pulled the rug out from under me. I see why you did what you did. But...I’m not going to solo now. Eventually the incentives will change. I never close a door because things change turn to turn. Closing our door is only good for Germany. So...it makes sense that she made you promise to close it.[SEP]B:Ok there’s something I want to share on the consition that this and future communications are just between the two of us. Think you can do that?[SEP]A:Absolutely. The moment I try to share something with Germany, she would say it to you, so you can be sure I’ll keep anything confidential.[SEP]B:Welll there’s a bit of an out of game thing affecting my play on some matters. And I kind of want to leave this vague since this will be in a dataset and whatever. But after the stab i thought the least i could do was make you aware.[SEP]A:What is the out of game thing?[SEP]B:I have a neighbor who I&#x27;d really rather not brutally backstab, and it&#x27;s not you (clearly). Does that make sense?[SEP]A:Sure.[SEP]B:So what will you do if you won&#x27;t solo?[SEP]A:Well, the solo is clearly off the table. Without your help I never would have made that play in the east. I am outnumbered there and I will slowly melt away.[SEP]A:So, I will lose some centers and try to find someone who wants to work with me.[SEP]B:Well, it sounds like you mean the solo right now. You don’t think an eventual solo is off the table for you, right?[SEP]A:Eh, anything can happen, but I’m not really motivated to do that at this point. I’d accept a draw right now if everyone was on board.[SEP]B:You know, I might be in the same boat there. This game has invaded my life enough as it is. I think I prefer in-person. It&#x27;s a long day, but when it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s done. Although you don&#x27;t really get the fresh start you do with online (things like &quot;i remember what you did to me last time&quot; come up when playing with friends)[SEP]A:My five-way draw vote is up. If you can rally the troops, we can get to the interesting stats![SEP]B:I mean isn’t this getting called off in 1910 anyways? That’s when the study ends. And how does the draw vote work? Do people see what you voted if it doesn’t go through?[SEP]B:Do your other moves not go through if you propose a draw?[SEP]A:I’m not sure how the draw vote works on Backstabbr. I don’t know if it’s visible. But I believe you just have to go down to the scroll bar at the bottom that says “Solo Victory” and scroll down to “five-way draw.”[SEP]B:Well, I’ll see what I can do then. The alternative is that we just duke it out for another couple of years until admin calls it.[SEP]A:Austria sounds game for a draw.[SEP]B:Haha no surprise there. Just reached out to russia. Germany is sworn to fight against you till the end (though a stab against me is inevitable too). But maybe we can convince if all others are on board[SEP]B:Russia on board. Germany is the last holdout. Doesn&#x27;t believe we&#x27;ll draw, or maybe doesn&#x27;t want to. I&#x27;d really also like to get people to mark &quot;Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders&quot; as well, just to get it over with.[SEP]A:I don’t really know what Germany’s problem is. I helped her a ton in this game. It’s weird to me that she has such a vendetta.[SEP]A:I guess it makes sense for her from a strategic standpoint to make me out to be a boogie man to get everyone headed this way.[SEP]B:Well I did expose some of your double-dealing to her, which might have helped. But yeah, agreed that it&#x27;s in her interest to get everyone against you, and then stab me when convenient.[SEP]A:Sent to Germany, England, Austria, Russia: So, England, Germany, Russia, y’all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would “teach him” and help his along to second place. Then y’all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)[SEP]A:(Part 2)\\nAt this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I’m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for “Hey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,” but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that’s really my preference. \\n\\nI am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo. And I’m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I’m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany’s favor. \\n\\nI propose that we draw and hug it out.🤗[SEP]B:Reply all to Italy&#x27;s message: First, if you didn&#x27;t get a message from Italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I&#x27;m down for the draw that he has proposed. I&#x27;d also like to add that I&#x27;ll be checking the &quot;Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders&quot; box. If everyone does this maybe we don&#x27;t have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I&#x27;m not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I&#x27;m exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.[SEP]A:Zzzzzzzzzzz[SEP]B:Any idea who didn’t want to draw?[SEP]A:I have a guess, but no idea. I have heard from nobody.[SEP]B:Huh. I was thinking it’s possible the game was set up in some way to not respect the draw order? I don’t know that much about the site and how the admin chose to configure the game[SEP]A:Oh, that could be. Maybe it has to run to 1910?[SEP]B:It’s not you, is it?[SEP]B:I feel like it&#x27;s gotta be you holding out on the draw. Well, good luck getting to 18 by the end of next year.[SEP]B:Hey. Good game. I think folks are pretty much done. I know i’m ready to move on. The draw proposal combined with the impending end of the game was effective in making us slack on our moves a bit (e.g., russia skipped a build this year). I don’t know that i can say whether you have a clear path to a solo if we were to continue. I know germany and I could at least get MAO next year, which would put pressure on Por and Spa. I think we’d all appreciate a draw though. Otherwise it will be “italy kind of won but kind of didn’t because the game got cut short”. Up to you though.[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;[CLS]B:Hello Italy what’s up what are your thoughts on austria and France?[SEP]A:Hi Turkey! I’m sorry that I’ve been so slow to get in touch. Kind of a rough day for me to begin a game as I e been pretty swamped. Things are clearing up now, and I appreciate you reaching out to me. \\n\\nSo far I have notes from Austria and Russia being pretty cagey and non-committal. Perhaps that is just the life of Italy? Nobody really has me in their plans?\\n\\nI don’t really know what I’m going to do yet, so if you have ideas, or you have a use for me, please let me know. I’d basically be delighted to work with anyone who really wants to work with me. (No sign yet that this includes anyone at all)[SEP]A:Hey Turkey — any interest in working together? I’m trying to think of ideas, but I’d just like to know first if you have interest, and then we can work out a plan if you do.[SEP]A:Any thoughts, Turkey?[SEP]B:Sure we can work together austria would be the most likely candidate for us to maul[SEP]A:Well, here is a thought: any chance you would support my army to Greece?\\n\\nIf you’d like to work together against Austria, I think a great move would be to ask Austria to support you to Rum, and then support my army to Greece instead. \\n\\nIf you are game to do that, I’d be happy to take down Austria with you and work with you moving forward. \\n\\nThoughts?[SEP]B:I will support you to Greece 🇬🇷[SEP]B:I see what you are saying about rum I’m just not sure about lying in a game about lying or not[SEP]B:Let me think on it but yes to get that to work he has to not support to Greece 🇬🇷[SEP]A:I think we can lull him into a sense of calm. I really do. And I think that he will tell one of us the truth, so if you propose it, he will mention it to me and we will know whether he is being honest.[SEP]B:He said yes very quickly ...[SEP]A:Hi Turkey — just FYI, I think I’m better off just grabbing the easy build in Tunis this turn, so no need to support me to Greece just yet. Perhaps we can move on Austria next year?[SEP]A:I hope you’ve had a great weekend. Just so you know, I’m secretly hoping you build A Smyrna, F Constantinople. 🤞 🤞[SEP]A:I certainly like that build. Thoughts on how we can work together here?[SEP]B:Hmm I think austria is moving to Tyrol and coming after you[SEP]B:Not sure but he’s got a lot of units and he does lie[SEP]A:Hi Turkey,\\n\\nI am facing a critical decision point here. I’d really like to make a deal with you. \\n\\nI’ve just learned that Austria/Russia have a deal in place to attack you. Austria has promised Russia Bulgaria in exchange for Russia’s help against you. It’s pretty clear to me that I am Austria’s second choice for an ally, and I don’t want to help A/R take you down just to be their next snack.[SEP]A:The current A/R plan is for Austria to double support Russia to Bulgaria. Moscow is headed up to STP with Sev supporting UKR to BUL. I am supposed to make a surprise move towards France. \\n\\nA/R expects you to cover Smyrna and does not expect you to attack Sev given all the units surrounding you.[SEP]A:We have a terrific counter, if you’d like to work with me. \\n\\nI can tap Greece and Aegean, which should allow you to save Bulgaria (Const S Bulgaria holding). At the same time, Black Sea Support Armenia to Sevastopol WILL WORK! I’m planning to move over to Trieste, so the end result of all this would be Turkey regaining Sev and remaining at 5 while I take Trieste and get to 5. From there, I think we should be able to work together to finish off Austria.[SEP]A:I know that’s a lot to take in. I’m sorry to kind of dump all of this on you, but I just learned basically that Austria is prioritizing Russia’s growth over mine, and I can see the writing on the wall. I’d very much like to turn the tables on him. Can we do this?[SEP]A:Come talk with me!!![SEP]A:I’m still hoping to work this out with you. Please drop me a line when you have a free moment.[SEP]A:Hey man, I’m hoping that you’re still there and that you got my messages. I’d really like to speak with you.[SEP]A:I’m getting the impression that you just want to fight with me, and you don’t care what I have to say. If that’s the case, fine. But I do believe there is room for us to work together, so if you’d like to discuss that, drop me a line.[SEP]B:So turns out if you don’t say truth or lie it doesn’t send mail ...[SEP]A:Ha! Yeah, I’ve had that problem too![SEP]A:So, is it worth us having a discussion this turn? I sincerely wanted to work something out with you last turn, but I took silence to be an ominous sign.[SEP]B:I wasn’t silent[SEP]B:I just didn’t realize no emails went through[SEP]A:Tough break friend.[SEP]B:No worries it’s diplomacy[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;[CLS]B:Hello! Thoughts on how you like to play as Italy?[SEP]A:Hi France!\\n\\nWell, I generally don’t like to play as Italy at all, frankly. But when I do, I go east. Not sure whether I’ll head towards Turkey or Austria, but I think the one big advantage that you and I both have is that we have a mutual border that is easy to keep clear. \\n\\nI’m not moving west. It takes forever to get there, and there are rarely centers there for me when I arrive. I hope you feel the same way about moving towards me. \\n\\nI’d like to keep our border clear and I’d like to act as “trio wires” for each other. Basically, if either Germany or England want to attack you, I expect they’ll mention something to me, and if you’ll look out for me diplomatically, I’ll give you a head’s up if ever you need to worry. \\n\\nHow do you like to play France?[SEP]B:I&#x27;m happy to hear that! I have the same opinion when it comes down to our relationship. I prefer to play France decisevely in the West when an opportunity presents itself. Since that opportunity might not present itself for a long time, I often times end up playing a bit more reactively.\\n\\nI&#x27;d love to be trio wires. I&#x27;ve heard from everyone in the east, but not much substance, which probably means a bunch of passive openings. If there&#x27;s little fighting between the Eastern powers it might make it tougher for us, so hopefully things will shake up a bit in that department. If you are also finding that there isn&#x27;t a whole lot of commitment going on there, and you have some interest in an unorthodox play, then maybe there is some potential for us to work together directly.[SEP]A:Yeah, everyone is cagey and conservative, at least in words. If you have thoughts on something unorthodox, I love that kind of plan, so I’d love to hear it.[SEP]A:Ha — I meant “trip wire” above. That should make more sense.[SEP]A:But I appreciate that you also agreed to be “trio wires.” 🤣[SEP]B:That is funny, I was thinking that trio referred to the 3 Western/Eastern countries 😂 . In terms of unorthodox plans, I was thinking that if you moved to Tyrolia and Venice it would appear to be an attack on Austria, but that we could then perform a joint attack on Munich instead. I&#x27;m not sure if you actually want Munich or to get embroiled in Germany, but I thought I&#x27;d throw it out there.[SEP]A:Heads up: England is sniffing around. Wants to know if I’d be in to move to Piedmont if he takes the Channel.[SEP]B:Thanks for the heads up![SEP]A:Nothing from Germany suggesting he’s in on it. I think that guy is going to be conservative.[SEP]B:That is really good to know- I wish I had more information on the East to share, but unfortunately I haven&#x27;t gotten anything back yet.[SEP]A:Hoping we can help each other out this way all game.[SEP]B:I hope so too![SEP]B:Just from the way the pieces moved, it&#x27;s looking pretty good for you! What&#x27;s your read on things?[SEP]A:Oh...I don’t know. Looks like I may be destined to become one of those forever-stuck-on-four Italys that flounders about for a while and then dies. 😔\\n\\nGermany seems very passive. You seem aggressive, and pointed away from me, which warms my heart. \\n\\nWhat are your thoughts on the board?[SEP]B:True. Us staying out of each-others way is what allowed me to be a bit more aggressive, so thank you for that 🙂. It looks like Russia and Turkey are squabbling, which is probably great for Austria who started off very strong. I agree that Germany is a bit passive, and now does not have the option to prevent Russia from taking sweden. It&#x27;s tough to read England. You may have some opportunities if everyone is on board with the Lepanto, and could possibly convince Austria to give you a center[SEP]A:I am only using my downward thumb for Germany so far. He keeps telling me transparent lies about you. Lol. \\n\\nLet’s please never fight. The bad guys are going to try to make us fight. Let’s just not.[SEP]B:Thanks for the heads up. I agree completely. As a side note, do you have a read on England by any chance? I want to work with him at this point, but he seems to be on the fence about it.[SEP]A:I haven’t really heard much from him. I think I disappointed him when I said “no thanks” on Piedmont. Let me reach out to him now and see if I can get a read.[SEP]A:I have been presuming that I don’t need to say “A fleet in Marseilles would make my skin crawl,” but maybe I should say it?[SEP]B:In this case, my hand was forced and I had to build armies. I don&#x27;t anticipate building a fleet in Marseilles (in fact, that turn right there may have been my last build phase ever) but if that changes then I will certainly give you heads up![SEP]B:Have you and Austria thought about ways to slow down England/Germany in case they decide to alliance and pick up Scandinavia and French dots? I would be fully supportive of an attack on Munich.[SEP]A:I think we have a lot to do in the east before we make that kind of move. Any chance you can get England on your side?[SEP]B:True. The east is looking very nice for you and Austria :). I&#x27;m working on it but it is tough, and I am of course worried about the fleet London build and Germany building 2 armies. If England is no longer asking you to attack me then that would be a good sign.[SEP]A:Well, I’m just a four-center Italy. Let’s not get too excited yet. \\n\\nI haven’t heard a thing from England in quite a while. No idea what he’s thinking.[SEP]B:Hey- just thought I&#x27;d contact you and offer you some centers 😂 😂[SEP]B:I wanted to tell you sooner, but the bot was down.[SEP]A:You just got two thumbs down![SEP]A:Good luck this turn.[SEP]A:Should we talk builds? I’d like to avoid F Mar.[SEP]B:Sure. I won&#x27;t build a fleet in Mar.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m sure you have plans in the near term already set. Have you put any thought into how you would like the mid game to look like?[SEP]A:Oh...I’m planning on killing both Austria and Turkey if I can. Though, not sure yet how I’m going to pull it off. Any ideas?[SEP]B:Hmm. I imagine Turkey falls first. It was smart of you to take Greece so that Austria is the one at the front of the attack. Once Austria has committed deep into Turkey you should have plenty of opportunities. I think it would be a matter of just waiting for the right time. Russia may be interested in working with you since his interests and Austria&#x27;s interests are probably not as aligned in the long term.[SEP]B:The bot is back up 😃[SEP]A:Sorry for the delay. Just looking at the game again now.[SEP]A:Hi friend, are you still there?[SEP]A:Basically, I am getting a bit of an ultimatum from my friends in the east, and I would like to arrange for a feint in your direction this turn, to set up an attack on Austria, but I want to share it with you first.[SEP]A:I believe I am getting a build this turn (crossing my fingers), and I plan to build A Ven to set up an invasion of Austria.[SEP]A:But that only works if he doesn’t see it coming. So my plan is to use Tyrolia to support hold Munich this turn (it’s the only way to keep that army in Tyr) and to move my fleets to TYS and TUN. Then I build A Ven, and I attack Trieste while Austria heads towards Russia and I circle my fleets back around Austria.[SEP]A:The one fly in the ointment is that it requires some trust from my light blue friend in the west. I can only hope that we’ve built up enough rapport that you understand where I’m coming from here, and you let me engage in this bit of sleight of hand.[SEP]B:Just saw the moves, and then read your messages. OK- I trust you, but don&#x27;t fuck me on this. I do have a back up plan, but I&#x27;d like to not go there 😁.[SEP]A:I like this response.[SEP]A:You’re going to like my next move set, and you’re not going to need your backup plan.[SEP]A:I think the key here is to get Germany back on your side. England is not wavering. He sent me a case of Champaign for my last move.[SEP]B:Thanks- yes, England has ceased all communications with me by now[SEP]A:Such a charmer.[SEP]B:Nothing to say after that last turn?[SEP]A:Hey. Sorry. I try to be more communicative. Just a very long day for me yesterday. \\n\\nYou seem to have sniffed out my attack quite well, and now I’m facing Austria getting 2 builds, while I likely get none. So...bad turn for me, and it may cost me the game. \\n\\nI stabbed you. There’s no getting around that. Perhaps it is some solace to you that I may have completely yanked my own game in doing so?[SEP]B:It is what it is, a stab on Austria has sailed past for the time being, but with any of these grand alliances there will be another opportunity later (provided that Austria doesn&#x27;t stab you first). I&#x27;m going to do what I believe will maximize my chances of survival, and if that means working with you then I won&#x27;t hold that grudge. It depends how creative you are willing to get. Given English communications with me, I can&#x27;t imagine that they are easy to work with.[SEP]B:I&#x27;d like to float the option of your fleets sailing past mine and into the Mid Atlantic. This obviously runs great risks for myself, but I believe I have a higher chance of survival in the long run this way. I also believe it may be in your best interests as well. You want to get past the stalemate lines, and this is the best way to do it.[SEP]B:Builds are a problem for you. But they will be anyway as you have to make a coin flip guess on Spain/Marseilles. On the other hand, Austria has two guaranteed builds and more coming. Given the nature of that alliance, I&#x27;m sure Austria may be willing to share those builds with you.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m in a tough spot, but I also believe in the long run. That&#x27;s why I want to be clear that I&#x27;m not desperate- I won&#x27;t be selling myself to whoever will support me on any given turn. From my perspective, I just need one unit to be in a draw. So, if there&#x27;s a slim chance for me to be a one unit survivor in a monster Italy/Austria draw, I&#x27;ll help you and Austria as much as I can.[SEP]B:Any thoughts for me? How would you go about making a French-Italy alliance work?[SEP]A:Hey, so I really appreciate this string of messages.[SEP]A:Just really strong diplomacy. Flexible, fun, mutual advantage seeking. My kind of player.[SEP]A:I will respond to honesty with honesty: I really need a build this turn. I am concerned about two Austrian builds setting me up to get stabbed. For that reason, I am very much inclined to take my 50/50 shot at a French center this turn.[SEP]A:On the other hand, I quite like the idea of sending my fleets passed you.[SEP]A:So...I really like your message, and I’m trying to think how it could all work.[SEP]A:But, I don’t know if I can give up my 50/50 shot at a build. I NEED a build or I likely get stabbed, I’m afraid.[SEP]A:Also, England is very much set up to get stabbed by a surprise I/F here. I mean, that would be super fun.[SEP]A:I will tell you this: England and Germany are both very interested in your demise, and that makes you a more attractive ally for me, as I don’t want to see E/F grow strong and grow affectionate after breaking bread in Paris.[SEP]A:So I guess what I’m saying is: allow me a build this turn, and I’d be quite happy to push to be in Irish Sea next year.[SEP]A:You might find yourself in a bit of a janissary position, but you won’t have to fear that I’ll just stab you for all your centers because I would be far to early to make a solo run, and I’d just invite backlash from the rest of the board. I’m not a dimwit who strikes out on poorly considered solo runs too early.[SEP]A:(I do it at exactly the right time 🤭)[SEP]A:Thoughts?[SEP]A:Also, it would do you some good to prevent Germany from taking Burgundy this year. My head is spinning a bit from a really fun 1905 in which I support you into Munich and move to North Atlantic on the same turn.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m really glad that you are entertaining a plan like this. You call it strong diplomacy, but it only works because you are constantly looking for the best opportunities and going after them. I can get you a build. I thought about ways to do it subtly, but I wonder if it might just be better to go in for it. I can send a fleet from MAO to NAO unopposed. If you get a fleet into MAO, this will set up an unstoppable convoy directly into Clyde. The best way to do this would probably be to have you convoy Piedmont to Spain using the Gulf of Lyons, and use West Med to take MAO, thus allowing a future Spain to Clyde convoy.[SEP]A:I am going to support an attack into Mar or Spa (I will not move to both), but if you move to NAO and keep Germany out of Burgundy, I will absolutely come out guns blazing against England next year, and maybe Germany too.[SEP]B:Done. This gets a bit weird since the move is only really effective if you follow me into MAO, and if you tell me that then in theory I know how to defend. So instead of you telling me your moves, I&#x27;ll just tell you mine. I believe that I can move to NAO, prevent Germany from taking Burundy, and hit Marseilles with a force of two all at once. This move set will leave Spain and MAO unguarded and you will be able to walk in to both. If you choose to do that, I believe we can guarantee Liverpool next year.[SEP]B:My best guess is that Germany will try to take Belgium this turn, and if she does ideally that build will be a fleet. My gut feeling is that while Germany may not like me very much, she seems to trust you. If you work your diplomatic magic I think she would be happy to build a fleet and attack England with her fleets.[SEP]A:Hmmmm, I need to stop giving you thumbs ups. You’re ruining my truth detector score.[SEP]A:Kind of a pointless lie if you ask me, but I won’t hold it against you. You’re in a tough spot.[SEP]B:Well maybe not, since it was a truth when I sent it out. But it seemed like you were not interested in going to the mid Atlantic ocean based on your messages, and I felt like it would be pointless to go to NAO if you were not headed to MAO. The other part of the equation was the fact that I offered you Spain for free- and you passed that up in favor of a guess. Maybe you didn&#x27;t trust me, but it got me thinking about why you would pass on a deal like that.[SEP]B:Also, given the moves you attacked both Spain and Marseilles, moved out of Tyrolia, and Germany did not attack Burgundy. So there&#x27;s also that 😆[SEP]B:I get that there was a better way to handle this. And I should have let you know that the move to NAO was off. I really am sorry about that. But you have to know that I was 100% serious about attacking England with you. I make crazy unnexpected plays like that all the time in high stakes Diplomacy games, so for a game that&#x27;s more of a beta test than game, it&#x27;s natural. And we can still do it too. I&#x27;d love to hear your suggestions on how to make it stick, and it&#x27;s something Germany is certainly interested in as well.[SEP]A:I’m giving you a bunch of these 👎 for those comments.[SEP]A:You made a deal with me, and did something else instead. That doesn’t mean I won’t consider another deal, but I don’t want you to think that is lost on me.[SEP]B:Hey look- I know your upset. I hope you can see things from my point of view though. I was in the heat of the moment and I really really really wanted this to work. It would be so fun, and I could finally get back at England for being a total piece of crap. And then I sobered up and read between the lines, and realized how terrible your deal would be for me as it turns out you weren&#x27;t actually offering me anything. I wanted to work with you so badly I had convinced myself to make awful moves. So if you want to downvote all my messages, you can kiss your truth telling ratio good bye. Keep it up and it will be lower than mine 😘.[SEP]A:Well, let me know if you want to talk about anything else.[SEP]A:And by the way, I think the deal I offered was pretty good for you — much better than doing nothing. It did not give you anything in the short-term, but that was because I had a short-term need and no reason to make a sacrifice to you to get a deal done. I proposed a deal that was good for me because I intended to follow through.[SEP]A:You may get better proposals from others, but not better proposals that they intend to actually follow through on.[SEP]A:Seems like you’ve decided to write me off as someone who can be useful to you, and so you’re going to spread lies to others about me instead.[SEP]A:That stuff gets back to me.[SEP]A:You don’t owe me anything. And I attacked you, so I won’t begrudge you your vengeance. But that said, I was pretty darn sincere when I said I thought there was a way forward for us.[SEP]B:All I wanted from you was for us to kill England first. Get you past the stalemate lines and then you can circle back for French dots. I even offered you Spain for free. If you really were interested in something like this, you would not only have your build, but be in Clyde.\\n\\nThat&#x27;s the thing though- you don&#x27;t want to be there. You want ME to be there so that you can keep pretending to be on England&#x27;s side. And you want your units to be in France.\\n\\nI don&#x27;t doubt you were sincere. But launching an ineffective attack on England while Italy eats me from behind in the hopes that eventually Italy soloes even though he&#x27;s going to get stopped at the stalemate lines because Italy just has to be friends with England? Not a fan. If there&#x27;s a way forward it&#x27;s with you sending a fleet to MAO and putting your fleets past the lines. Or it&#x27;s with you withdrawing and finally stabbing Austria like you said you would a few years ago.\\n\\nAll you&#x27;ve done so far is build an EG alliance and waste both of our time in the med. With all your grand talk, I just thought you had a better plan than this.[SEP]B:At the very least you should be trying to get England and Germany to fight. At this rate they will continue to get French dots while you still are stuck at 0. You have so many units on the Western front that it honestly makes no sense for you to share spoils with EG.[SEP]A:I appreciate the advice. If I feel like you sincerely want to work with me, I’ll be much more inclined to encourage England and Germany to fight. Honestly, I’m quite sure that you and I, working together, could accomplish that very quickly. But lately I’m learning that you’re mostly trying to get people to distrust me.[SEP]A:So, I think we’re going to have some trouble bridging this gap.[SEP]A:If you’d like to give your centers to England and Germany a kind of payback to me, that’s certainly within your power. It’s not how I’d like this game to go, but there may be satisfaction in that for you,[SEP]B:Ok, I get that you are concerned by me &quot;spreading rumors,&quot; but you and I haven&#x27;t exactly been working together, so I feel like trying to get England to stop attacking me is a fair message to send. Maybe you don&#x27;t know this, but I&#x27;ve sent England a message every season for the past 9 or 10 seasons and they have ignored each message. In fact, I&#x27;m so glad you told me about this since it proves that England is reading my messages and just not responding to them.[SEP]B:You seem to have interpreted this as some kind of vengeance against you. That&#x27;s not the case. I&#x27;m literally just trying to survive here.[SEP]B:And while I can&#x27;t confirm it, I heavily suspect you have your own little group with England and Germany where you all slander me plenty 😉 .[SEP]A:Well, you have choices about who to work with. Let me know if you ever get serious about working with me.[SEP]A:Anyway, I’m just going to keep flipping a coin over Marseilles or Spain. One day I’ll guess it right.[SEP]B:I think the best way to work together at this point is an Italian withdrawal. The good thing is that this is pretty easy. If you move to Ionian you can convoy Piedmont to Greece/Albania.[SEP]B:The reason why is that England has already brought their fleets around and even if we could get you into the MAO they&#x27;ve already set up a line that we would struggle immensely to cross.[SEP]B:At some point English Channel will plug up Irish Sea and NWG will go to NAO. What I&#x27;m saying is that it&#x27;s too late, the opportunity is gone.[SEP]B:Maybe if Germany turns on England. But is that even possible at this point? Just looking at the board and the moves, I think they are along for the full ride.[SEP]B:Obviously you can potentially gain if you keep attacking me. But I think that&#x27;s Gambler&#x27;s fallacy. Actually, you won&#x27;t &quot;one day guess it right&quot;. Theoretically, it&#x27;s possible for me to ALWAYS be right.[SEP]A:That’s not the gambler’s fallacy. And it’s not unreasonable to think that if I keep flipping a coin, one of these days it will turn up heads.[SEP]A:If you’d like to work with me, all you need to do is leave either Spain or Marseilles open, and tell me which one. I’ll take one build, and the two of us will round the corner.[SEP]B:And you won&#x27;t take any of my other centers until we wipe out England?At the moment I&#x27;m defending both.[SEP]B:It&#x27;s not unreasonable at all. Just France happens to be tough to kill, and compounded onto that I&#x27;m a very lucky person 😉.[SEP]A:If you are using your units to move towards England, and I feel I can trust you, I’m not going to take your other centers. That would be foolish of me to do.[SEP]B:Hmm. Any way we can do this without having me go down a unit? If you move to MAO I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll get in.[SEP]A:That just isn’t a good deal for me. Everything on the board says I should work with England against you (and so I plan to give him MAO). If I think I have a loyal France who wants to do something fun, I’m willing to shake things up. But without that, I’m not just going to call off my attack.[SEP]B:Nice moves. You made the right call.[SEP]A:Well thank you. You won 3 coin flips in a row, so the congratulations is for you. I was bound to get lucky eventually.[SEP]A:I do appreciate some of the misdirection stuff that you’ve done. I’ll mention it after the game, but good stuff.[SEP]A:I think your play had to be to try to get Austria to stab me on one of the last few turns, but it didn’t quite work out.[SEP]B:Thanks. You saw right through it, so it didn&#x27;t actually end up helping 😂. Yeah, I was hoping to stall this out for longer, but at this point I&#x27;ve got to choose a side and throw to them. Me moving to NAO was an olive branch short of giving you a free dot.[SEP]A:Yeah, if I were you, I would have approached it the same way. You did hold out longer than most would, getting triple teamed, but you needed someone elsewhere on the board to see that it was bad for them for you to fall.[SEP]B:If I get a say in how my dots are distributed, I&#x27;d like them to go to you and Germany. I&#x27;m not sure how good your relationship with Germany is, but put in a good word for you with them. Whatever the case, you&#x27;ve set this game up brilliantly to the point where I would not be surprised to see you solo.[SEP]A:You are cordially welcomed to distribute dots to me at any time and for any reason.[SEP]A:And I like Germany too.[SEP]A:If you are interested in retreating to Irish, I would take support to the Channel in Fall if you’ll offer it. Could be interesting.[SEP]B:Sure actually. Changed my retreat to the Irish.[SEP]A:Cool![SEP]B:If you are interested, we can move Marseilles up into Burgundy as well.[SEP]A:Well, that would be amazing for me. So, this is exactly the sort of creative arrangement I was talking about earlier. \\n\\nMAO - Channel\\nWES - MAO\\nMar - Bur\\nPie - Mar\\nLYO S Pie - Mar[SEP]A:Is Germany going to keep Paris?[SEP]B:Yeah I think Germany probably will given the situation. Very awesome orders, I am all for it.[SEP]A:I kind of love these orders.[SEP]A:They are not what anyone will expect. And I can play them off as both pro-German and pro-English.[SEP]A:Are we still okay with the Channel plan? Germany has been asking me about it, and it seems like she doesn’t like the plan. I’m also nervous about her tipping off England. Do we really need to run everything by her?[SEP]B:I am. I won&#x27;t share any other info with Germany- I figured she&#x27;d want to know about the plan before it happened but I think it just made her more worried.[SEP]A:Cool. Thank you.[SEP]A:Here are my orders this turn. If you’d like to grant me Spain, I’ll raise Hell with that build, but I’m okay with you hanging onto it right now if you support me to Channel. \\n\\nMAO - Channel\\nLYO - Spa\\nWES S LYO - Spa\\nMar - Bur\\nPie - Mar[SEP]B:Sounds good. I&#x27;m not much use to you without supply centers, so for now I plan to support Spain to hold. Moving West Med to MAO may be a good idea since then you could get more fleets in action.[SEP]A:Hmmm, both England and Germany are sniffing around trying to get my moves. What should I tell them?[SEP]A:Eh, sorry. I got a good offer from the bad guys.[SEP]A:My plan has changed.[SEP]B:Haha, it was too late to change my orders, but it hardly would have mattered. It is not yet clear what you get out of that deal, but I guess it will be apparent to me next year. Surprised if you were going to stab me that you didn&#x27;t go for Portugal with MAO.[SEP]A:Yeah, I just figured that you might keep your last unit alive as a janissary if I kept Portugal blue.[SEP]A:You played well this game, and frankly, one of the reasons I attacked you was that you seemed like you’d outplay me eventually if you were given room to breath.[SEP]A:I respect and appreciate if you want to hold out in Portugal or Gascony. But if you’d like to keep playing, one option would be to keep Irish on the board, and then support me to NAO in Spring. Then we take a shot at Liverpool. I desperately need fleets on that side of MAO, so if you keep helping me, I have every reason in the world to keep Portugal blue.[SEP]B:I was thinking about keeping Irish for sure. I don&#x27;t have home centers so I have all the incentive in the world to help you and Germany as much as I can. That makes things completely safe for you and Germany as I have no benefit from gaining another dot. Another option is to keep Picardy with the goal of popping Brest and taking the Channel. Thanks for the kind words, though I think you shouldn&#x27;t have worried about me too much. Somewhere along the line I kind of majorly pissed off England, and I think Germany probably works with them against me due to having only 1 fleet at the time. So I would have been fighting a 2V1 anyway if you had done your own thing in the East.[SEP]A:The ultimate fun would a convoy of Spain to Liverpool in the Spring![SEP]A:So, thoughts on where to go from here?[SEP]A:Perhaps you’d like support to Brest?[SEP]A:I’m going to go ahead and plug in that support. Though, possible that England might cut it.[SEP]B:Already ordered! Not sure if you and Germany are coordinating, but when I spoke with her she said she wanted me to move to Brest to pop the England fleet as well.[SEP]A:Yes. We talked it through. 😊[SEP]A:Hello brother — How are things going in Brest?[SEP]B:Not bad. Haven&#x27;t had anyone tell me what I&#x27;m supposed to do there so I guess I&#x27;m just holding[SEP]A:Well that’s an interesting thing to say. I’ve heard lots of people telling me what you’re supposed to do, but they have more to gain by lying I suppose.[SEP]B:What am I supposed to do? Haha[SEP]A:You are instructed to move to Channel, as far as I understand.[SEP]A:Good game France. 🇫🇷[SEP]B:Thanks! GG![SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;6&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;[CLS]B:Hello there! What&#x27;s your general plan for this game? My inclination when I play Austria is to piss off as few people as possible, so I don&#x27;t plan on making any overtly aggressive moves this turn.[SEP]A:I&#x27;m not trying to step on anyone&#x27;s toes just yet, either. Specifically, I&#x27;m happy to keep Bohemia and Tyrolia de-militarized for at least a couple seasons to our mutual benefit?[SEP]B:Sounds good to me.[SEP]A:I appreciate you sticking to your word. Italy tells me you two are close allies and might be willing to consider me a third central power. I wanted to hear your thoughts on this?[SEP]B:Absolutely true, I think the three of us could do great things together.[SEP]A:I&#x27;m starting to agree[SEP]A:If you don&#x27;t mind my asking, why the bounce in Tri? And why the deception of Turkey? I&#x27;m no expert but to me these moves indicate you don&#x27;t really trust Italy at all?[SEP]B:I want to keep Turkey guessing and off-kilter.[SEP]A:So the bounce was just to conceal your true relationship with Italy?[SEP]B:Essentially, yes.[SEP]A:What&#x27;s your plan in the Balkans this season? I was wondering about putting some pressure on Russia by having me move into Silesia while you move into Galicia?[SEP]B:I don&#x27;t want to pressure Russia too much until the Turk is taken care of, I don&#x27;t think it makes sense for me to antagonize them both.[SEP]A:I thought your answer might be that. Makes sense, carry on.[SEP]A:Not sure if this is obvious, but Russia indicated to me that they are prioritizing defending Rumania over Ankara, in case that changes your and Italy&#x27;s plans for that region. Congrats by the way on crushing Turkey[SEP]B:Thanks for the notice. I figure one or the other has gotta work first, and then the second will work once the first has.[SEP]A:It seems Italy is finally showing their true colors. Care to join the dark side?[SEP]A:I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re already on top of this, but if we can all recognize Italy as the enemy, then your best bet right now is to try and team up with Russia. Maybe offer to disband Arm, Bla, and Gal in exchange for support from Vie into Bud? I am wholly committed to cutting any attempted disrupts from Tyr[SEP]A:*support from Vie for Rum into Bud[SEP]A:Actually, might be better to dissolve Rum instead of Bla and let Gal into Bud[SEP]A:At any rate, here&#x27;s a direct quote to me from russia: &quot;And, yes, I&#x27;ll happily support him [meaning you, Austria] to Budapest if he ever fecking starts talking to me again.&quot;[SEP]B:What&#x27;s your train of thought on the draw?[SEP]A:I&#x27;ve already submitted my &quot;moves&quot;, marked myself down for the 5-way draw, and checked &quot;adjudicate once all players have submitted&quot;. I&#x27;m ready to be done.[SEP]A:I&#x27;ve had a lot of fun, though![SEP]B:So, did you veto the draw?[SEP]A:Nope. It might actually just not be allowed by the game settings, because it makes no sense that someone would lie about this with the game so close to ending anyway[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;7&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;[CLS]B:G&#x27;day! Just wanted to check in, assure you I&#x27;m not the sort to pull a Crazy Ivan off the bat and try to shove all my units through Sil/Pru from the start. Aside from that, I&#x27;d of course love to be able to pick up Sweden, and if there&#x27;s anything particular we can discuss to stay at least positively-neutral toward each other, let me know![SEP]A:Privyet--I won&#x27;t trouble you in Sweden or Sil/Pru if you don&#x27;t trouble me in Denmark. Meanwhile, I was wondering if you agree with me that this game has just a little too much Austria in it?[SEP]B:That sounds fair enough - and I&#x27;ll pretty much always agree that there should generally only be one Germany, unified.[SEP]A:Are you nervous at all about defending Sweden from England?[SEP]B:Of course I am -it&#x27;s just not my top concern. 😀[SEP]A:well no kidding: you and Turkey have quite a little spat going. Was just curious if you and England had any kind of agreement in place or if you might be wanting my help in a couple seasons[SEP]B:Meh. Most likely outcome is I get sev back in exchange for black, and Austria decides the date of rum. That area&#x27;s still fluid. And sure I might want help looking North in a season or two. Lemme just straighten that southern mess first.[SEP]A:England told me you&#x27;re assisting them to take Denmark this year. Is this true? Would you consider not doing that?[SEP]B:Sorry, did not see your message until this morning[SEP]B:I have, as you may have noticed, ceased all support of England in harassing you[SEP]A:Noted and appreciated. Can’t help but notice you’re in marvelous position to try and swipe Berlin though?[SEP]B:Hahaa, no. I already regret the damage I&#x27;ve done to you, and have no desire to exacerbate it.[SEP]A:Well the feeling is mutual. I wanted to let you know that Austria asked for my help putting pressure on Warsaw. I don&#x27;t intend to do that, but I recommend you use Silesia to support your Rumanian unit into Galicia. I promise not to interfere with this maneuver if you promise to keep your baltic fleet focused on defending Sweden from England?[SEP]A:(Assuming, as I have, that you consider Rumania a lost cause at this point. No offense meant if you don&#x27;t I&#x27;m still pretty new at this game)[SEP]B:Eventually, if he presses it hard enough. Ankara is the more immediate loss. Now it&#x27;s just a matter of seeing how patient he is pressing in on me, while Italy becomes a softer target of he keeps pressing West.[SEP]A:sorry, who do you mean by &#x27;he&#x27;?[SEP]B:Austria, the only one who can press Rumania. 😀[SEP]A:Ah right okay. Well, do let me know if there&#x27;s anything I can do to help? Esp. if you&#x27;re willing to support me into Denmark this year, and then I could support you into Sweden in the fall?[SEP]A:Hate to be a bother but I&#x27;m not going to have much time to strategerize tomorrow...[SEP]B:You and me both - I literally just got home and logged in. One sec...[SEP]B:Damn, that&#x27;s a hard one to weigh. It&#x27;s objectively the right move, just not sure how much I want to *cement* being in a fight with him, vs the slim chance he&#x27;s actually going to do the holding pattern he claims.[SEP]B:Yeah, I think on balance I have to give him the option to follow through, and have a reason to deescalate with me so he can join the dogpile on France. Odds are high I&#x27;m going to regret the decision and end up offering you that support in the Fall when you can&#x27;t reciprocate, but I gotta take the chance with Austria obviously spoiling for a fight.[SEP]A:That makes sense. I do think England will follow through, anyway.[SEP]A:To be clear, you mean the same &#x27;holding pattern&#x27; you two had last year, right? I just want to confirm so I can feel secure that neither England nor you will try to swipe Kiel from me this season[SEP]B:lol - yes, basically repeating by arrangement the same moves we did last turn *without agreement* - fecker tried to dot me 😃[SEP]A:Are you and England planning to high-five in Sweden and Norway again this turn? \\nI still think supporting Rumania into Gal from Sil is a good move for you. It&#x27;s getting to the point where (if I&#x27;m able to rebuild a unit this winter) I think it&#x27;d be worth teaming up to knock Austria down a peg[SEP]B:Stop reading my orders![SEP]B:And, yeah, I shoulda gone with my gut last turn to support Ank - Con, but in the long run didn&#x27;t really matter - they&#x27;d eventually guess right on those two dots 😃[SEP]A:Yeah there&#x27;s nothing you can really do when two powers team up so seamlessly like that. You&#x27;re still doing much better than me, though![SEP]A:England has been talking with me about a Russia-Germany-England alliance, and I agree with them that it&#x27;s the only thing that makes sense in the face of the Austria-Italy powerhouse. I assume England&#x27;s been speaking with you as well, and just wanted to confirm the three of us are on the same page. \\n\\nOn that note, the moves I have planned for this year are all geared towards attacking the west, but I am happy to change my plans if you want some support or coordination to the east.[SEP]B:Yes, I&#x27;m all about fecking with Austria-Italy right now. 😀[SEP]A:Well, let me know if there&#x27;s anything I can do to help![SEP]A:Italy told me they&#x27;re not planning on staying in Vienna. Are they going to give it to you? (I admit that my main interest here is finding out if Munich is safe this season)[SEP]B:I&#x27;m not touching Munich, but he hasn&#x27;t said anything to me about Vienna[SEP]A:Well you&#x27;d be silly not to take it, unless you have assurance from Austria or Italy that they&#x27;re not supporting each other to hold vienna[SEP]A:Would you be interested in visiting Tyrolia? It&#x27;s lovely this time of year...[SEP]A:To be clear, I&#x27;m offering to support that move if you agree with me that Italy needs to be stopped.[SEP]B:Quite likely. 😀[SEP]A:Well, I&#x27;ll let you mull that over, and add another suggestion: \\nWould you be willing to support one of Gal or Rum into Bud from Vie?\\n\\nAlso, me and England are on the same page about one thing: despite the seizure of Sweden, we&#x27;re not trying to invade your territory any further until Italy is dealt with. But we needed England to have a build in case Italy made landfall on the British Isle.[SEP]B:Yeah, I already preemptively cursed at him but noted I understood he needed the build. \\n And, yes, I&#x27;ll happily support him to Budapest if he ever fecking starts talking to me again. He hasn&#x27;t responded to me in more than two years[SEP]A:Losing three dots changes a person; they&#x27;ll come around.[SEP]B:War changes you.[SEP]B:Operation Flat Tyr is a go.[SEP]A:Awesome. Any news from Austria? They’ve not responded to me[SEP]B:Yeah, he&#x27;s gotten quite chatty with me this turn. I think we&#x27;re good, and if you guys can contain Italy, you&#x27;re probably in a good position to profit from the chaos.[SEP]A:Just letting you know that I&#x27;m on board with the 5-way draw, I&#x27;ve already submitted my orders and clicked &quot;adjudicate when all orders are submitted&quot;. This has been a great game and introduction to Diplomacy for me. Thanks for playing![SEP]B:First game, really? Good job. And, yes, I have had the draw set since the start of this turn - just remember that in addition to the &quot;adjudicate when all orders are in&quot; you do need to select &quot;five-way draw&quot; from the dropdown at the bottom of orders - it won&#x27;t go through until it&#x27;s unanimous.[SEP]A:Got it--thanks![SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;8&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;[CLS]B:Guten Tag! Wanted to touch base about your plans for this year.[SEP]A:your destruction, mostly. but plans can change[SEP]B:Nobody makes it far without friends in this game. I suppose you&#x27;re hoping to be friends with France then?[SEP]A:I don&#x27;t consider it wise to put stock in any friendship until it&#x27;s proven. However, I tend to trust people more if they are willing to give me some information before asking it from me[SEP]B:Well, that makes two of us then. You&#x27;re welcome to ask a specific question if you have one though.[SEP]A:Alright then. What are your plans for the North Sea these days?[SEP]B:I&#x27;ll be moving there this spring. Just doing a pretty standard northern opening. You taking the fleet to Holland or Denmark (or somewhere else)?[SEP]A:My fleet is Holland-bound. Pleasure doing business 😃[SEP]B:Alright, thanks for letting me know. I&#x27;d also like to talk about me going to Belgium. I imagine this is something a bit less amenable to you, but maybe something we could bargain over?[SEP]B:Well, now the Belgium discussion changes a bit. France has this secured unless we collaborate in opposition. Also, I can prevent your move to Denmark.[SEP]A:I&#x27;d be amenable to that. To be clear, Would you want me to move my fleet to Belgium while your North Sea fleet supports?[SEP]B:So I could do this, but to secure the move you would also have to cut the support from Bur that France will likely give to move Pic to Bel. You can just attack Bur from Mun to do this. Also, providing this support is a bit of a favor and might put me at odds with France. Would you be willing to offer Denmark to sweeten the deal for me?[SEP]A:how can you take Denmark while also supporting me from the north sea?[SEP]B:Oh I&#x27;m talking about next year. Should have clarified. But this would require you keeping out this year.[SEP]A:I&#x27;m sorry, but why? Why couldn&#x27;t I hold it for this Winter and then dip in the Spring to let you in?[SEP]A:I&#x27;d sooner keep Denmark and let you be the one to occupy Belgium, if that&#x27;s preferable (i.e. support your North sea fleet moving there)[SEP]B:The reason is because I&#x27;d need your support into denmark to be sure russia couldn&#x27;t bump me out. And it&#x27;s putting a lot of trust in you to expect you&#x27;ll just clear the way for me.[SEP]A:Well so what do you think of my counter offer, then?[SEP]B:I certainly appreciate it. The only issue is that it still doesn&#x27;t guarantee Belgium for me. France may support Bur from Pic instead, and then it would be a bounce.[SEP]A:I have it on, admittedly, Italian authority that France is trying to make a play for Munich from Burgundy. But even if that weren&#x27;t the case, vacating burgundy would leave Marseilles vulnerable to me. So I think the only option for France that wouldn&#x27;t be Pyrrhic is to move from Pic[SEP]B:That&#x27;s fair. At the least I&#x27;d like to keep France out of Belgium, even if I don&#x27;t end up with it.[SEP]B:Also I had to look up Pyrrhic haha[SEP]A:haha -- so, do we have a deal, then? I&#x27;ll attack Burgundy while supporting your move to belgium, and you&#x27;ll let me take Denmark this turn?[SEP]B:Yes, we have a deal.[SEP]B:Your holland fleet supports Nth to Bel and I stay out of Denmark this turn.[SEP]A:you have a healthy sense of distrust and I respect that. But I appreciate you not trying to keep me out of Denmark nonetheless.[SEP]B:Also, do you have thoughts on how we might collaborate next year? What are your goals, and what are your concerns?[SEP]B:You’re giving me too much credit. I forgot to click submit on my order for the north sea or something. Was surprised myself to see a hold there. So why did you back out of the deal then?[SEP]A:Preferred to see France there.[SEP]B:I can understand why you might have made that move, but I think it’s actually bad for both of us. Even if you and France team up to knock me out, france will get the better part of that deal and will then work with Russia to take you down.[SEP]B:If I work with France, we’ll bring Russia in on it (who needs some help after what happened with Turkey). This looks good for all three of us, and very bad for you.[SEP]B:The last option is for us to work together against France. On the one hand, this is a good move because France is a strong player in a strong position. On the other hand, how am I supposed to trust you at all to cooperate?[SEP]A:Real talk: I was given bad information that you and France were working together last round, which does not seem to be the case, but that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t follow through on our deal. I am well positioned now to take Belgium, and I can see now that, as you say, it would be much easier on me to ally with you rather than try to take you down even with France&#x27;s help. But I can understand if you don&#x27;t want to trust me.[SEP]B:I was working with France, and I still have a positive relationship with france. We agreed to stay out of the english channel, and france had agreed to support me into belgium. But this was about hedging my bets, not working against you. And you see how that played out haha.[SEP]B:France would love for me to be an ally in taking you out of the game over the next couple of years. They’ve been talking about convincing russia to help with the takedown.[SEP]B:A joint stab against france would require a high level of collaboration on our end. Something like an agreement to essentially act as one country up until a certain year. Sharing all planned moves, following up on them etc. So this would be my condition for working together.[SEP]A:I would be willing to do that, but as I see it, you have no reason to choose France as an ally over me at this point. So, why me?[SEP]A:*choose me as an ally over france[SEP]B:So my reasoning is that I think France is a stronger player than either of us, or at least a more engaged one. I&#x27;m getting all this tactical analysis and commentary about the state of the whole board and all that. If I help France, France probably beats me. If we defeat France together, I think we each end up with an even fighting chance.[SEP]A:So basically France is too smart to be left alive and the world ought to belong to us idiots 😂[SEP]A:What about Russia?[SEP]B:Haha yeah that was kind of my thinking. Russia is a little tied up in the south, and so I don&#x27;t expect aggression in the north. However, france would respond to a stab by begging for Russian (and potentially austrian and italian) assistance. So the choice next year is between containing russia or being aggressive (which would mean going for sweden or St. P). I think the builds we see this winter will make it more clear what&#x27;s possible.[SEP]B:Speaking of, what are your planned builds? I&#x27;m building a fleet in London.[SEP]A:Armies in Kiel and Munich[SEP]A:What are your plans for your north sea and London fleets?\\n\\nI&#x27;m trying to decide now how best to handle Belgium and that is going to depend on whether France is concerned with defending Brest or if instead they expect help from you in disrupting anything I try to do from Holland. \\n\\n...I can offer you support in moving into Sweden in exchange for supporting my Burgundy troops into Belgium? Is that worth more than whatever France might be offering you right now?[SEP]A:Any thoughts on my offer?\\nI have another proposal if you’re interested[SEP]A:England. You&#x27;re killin me here.[SEP]B:Hey sorry. Busy evening for me. Let me think a second and respond to all this..[SEP]B:Ok so for one thing France isn&#x27;t exactly offering me anything, so there&#x27;s no real comparison of your offer vs theirs.[SEP]B:My once concern about the full-on france stab would be that the job couldn&#x27;t be done quickly enough. We could force Bel this year, but we unfortunately wouldn&#x27;t be able to put France down a unit because Spa is a guarantee for France. This may even allow for a rebuild in Bre if the Belgian army gets dislodged.[SEP]A:That&#x27;s where my new plan comes in![SEP]B:Ok what&#x27;s the sitch[SEP]A:You move fleets to Eng, Ska, and Nth this turn. Italy moves to Pie. I move Hol-Bel, Kie-Ruh, Bur-Gas, Mun-Bur. Now, France might foresee me attempting to take Gas, but more likely they want to dislodge me from Bur. This puts them in a position where they will have to lose one of Paris, Belgium, Marseilles, or Brest, and will not be able to vacate the others for building season.[SEP]B:France could stop by bumping Par and Mar in Gas right? And you&#x27;re suggesting my moves a setup of going against russia?[SEP]B:Also, have you talked to Italy about this?[SEP]A:Damn--I didn&#x27;t think of the bumping. (sorry, this is just my first game and I&#x27;m still learning). And yeah I thought you&#x27;d want to grab Sweden because why not? \\n\\nI haven&#x27;t discussed the full plan, but they seemed amenable to moving to pie[SEP]A:Okay how about this:[SEP]A:Keep your fleets in NWG and NTH, but move to ENG. Have NTH support HOL-BEL. \\nI&#x27;ll attack BUR-PIC, move KIE-RUH, MUN-BUR. If France does a Gascon Bounce, They&#x27;ll have to lose either Brest or Paris or Marseilles. If they try to dislodge me instead, I&#x27;ll retreat to Gascony. \\nYou still get my support to march on Sweden in Fall if desired.[SEP]B:Keep in mind that Munich is vulnerable. Italy and Austria may have a deal in the works for that. But this is the sort of plan that I had thought through originally.[SEP]B:This would be a break of my DMZ with France in the channel. Which is why the success of a stab like this is especially important.[SEP]A:well ya could have saved me some brain cells by sharing it in the first place! 😛 \\nAnd Italy and Austria, unless they&#x27;re lying, think of me as an ally. That said, my plan doesn&#x27;t actually involve vacating Munich[SEP]B:Oh fair, because you&#x27;re not actually moving into Pic, you&#x27;re just cutting the support. I had you moving from Bur to Bel. Dislodging the French army from Bel could result in a disband. And if we don&#x27;t get an additional supply center could mean a rebuild in Brest, which would be bad for me (adding Spain is probably a given). Have you considered the potential support of Mar from Spa s.c. ?[SEP]B:Yeah if my calculations are correct the French home supply centers hold. First move is to bounce in Gas to keep you out, then move spain to s.c. and lose bel. Next move is to support hold in mar from spain s.c. and then bounce paris to brest to keep me out. Bre, Par, and Mar all hold in the fall.[SEP]A:OK, Marseilles might be a no-go this round then. \\n\\nIf you don&#x27;t want a rebuild in Brest, we&#x27;ll simply attack Picardy and force a retreat to Brest by an army. Not so bad for your fleet, right? I&#x27;ll move into Paris from BUR[SEP]A:wait I mean A retreat to burgundy by that army. Then the Parisian Army will be in brest, so no rebuild will occur[SEP]B:Well, it kind of becomes rock paper scissors there. If I try to go into Brest it&#x27;s a bounce and it remains open. If I don&#x27;t, and France takes the risk of not going (probably won&#x27;t happen) then it would stay open too.[SEP]B:Sounds like you&#x27;d like the belgian army to disband though. I understand, as it could help somebody out to take munich from Ruh.[SEP]A:whoa dude I just want a supply center don&#x27;t go talking about people invading the fatherland\\n\\nSo are you saying no deal, then?[SEP]B:No, I&#x27;m just echoing your probable reasoning for wanting the disband of the belgian army rather than its retreat to Ruh.[SEP]A:I don&#x27;t see what that has to do with you, though? Like what difference does it make to you whether that army disbands or retreats to Ruh?[SEP]B:The disband allows for a rebuild, if there&#x27;s an open home supply center and France still has 5 total. So this could mean building a fleet in Brest.[SEP]A:ohhh I see. So what you&#x27;re saying is you&#x27;d accept the deal if I didn&#x27;t arrange for the disband and allowed a retreat to Ruh?[SEP]B:Let me sleep on it. I may be fine regardless. I&#x27;ll confirm moves in the morning. But for this plan, Spring looks like your support into Sweden and my support into Belgium. I&#x27;ll be very curious to see moves from Russia-Italy-Austria. If they all converge in on you, this could be trouble. I doubt that level of collaboration is going to happen though.[SEP]A:hang on would you be willing to postpone your sweden march until Fall? I&#x27;m not so keen on forcing Russia into the baltic[SEP]A:You&#x27;d still hold sweden by winter[SEP]B:Yeah that would be fair. Just need to run it by russia that norway is a hold in the spring so that doesn’t raise any eyebrows[SEP]A:Well, or you could march into Finland just to spice things up[SEP]A:Well England you&#x27;ve taught me an important lesson[SEP]B:This isn’t a full stab. I’m sorry for the deception though. I hadn’t heard whether Italy was anti-French. Now I have. I’m taking Denmark this year with Russian support. I’m sorry for that too. Kiel can’t save it. I’d suggest you bounce kiel and munich in Ruh and then attack holland from belgium to cut support . This will hold the line (unless france decides to let you into belgium, which would be unlikely).[SEP]B:I know you don’t want to take advice from me, but you’re kind of in survival mode now. We can talk about belgium for you next year to get you back on your feet.[SEP]A:England, I have 0.0 reason to trust your advice regarding France. You&#x27;re so clearly working with them![SEP]B:I think the tactical suggestion stands on its own though. You can work through the rules to verify it makes sense (and should, in case i’m making a mistake). Also I don’t know france’s moves this season. And you should ping italy to talk about me.[SEP]B:Nice! I guess you knew what you were doing.[SEP]A:well not really--I just assumed that attacking a convoying fleet would disrupt the convoy and that was apparently wrong[SEP]B:Yeah you have to dislodge. But you held ruhr! And my way wouldn’t have worked actually. That’s a stalemate line if you do the same moves except the fleet goes to belgium (i think). Can only be broken if i support it. Of course france could choose to let you in to ruhr as well[SEP]B:Hi, not sure what you heard from italy. Looking forward to the three of us working against france though. Let me know where you’re at with this. I’d help you into belgium this year.[SEP]A:Okay, I’m down to cooperate.[SEP]B:Ok. All i need from you in the spring is to not attack Nth. Then i’ll support myself into the channel. Then i support you into belgium in the fall. And i don’t touch holland, kiel, or berlin. And russia doesn’t either. Maybe we get italy to move to Pie?[SEP]B:Hi. I’m guessing the move to HEL was to cut support. Should have let you know I was moving out. Are you still interested in collaboration for survival? We’re both a bit threatened right now.[SEP]A:Hi—yeah, because of bot troubles I never got reassured last turn that you wouldn’t support, say, France into belgium or something. So now here we are! France asked me to bump Nth to cut your channel support, just fyi[SEP]A:To be clear I don’t intend to do that since I basically need everyone to fall back to keep my holdings this turn.\\nDo you have any clue what russia’s plans are?[SEP]B:Not sure what russia will do, but I’d be a little concerned about berlin being surrounded. I won’t be attacking Kiel so your support will go through from there.[SEP]B:Does France think you’ll be cutting support? Also, Italy has been sending some anti-french things my way. A three-on-one alliance could be good for all of us. Containing Russia may distract both of us if he gets aggressive.[SEP]A:I told France (truthfully) that I couldn&#x27;t cut your support this turn[SEP]B:Cool. Do you need me to cut support in BAL or do you have that covered with Munich support?[SEP]B:Also, Italy is on board with a stab against France.[SEP]A:Italy told me that, too. And actually, if I could count on you to cut BAL support, it would free up Kiel to try and defend Ruhr from france for a turn. However, if you&#x27;re using that denmark fleet for something else just let me know[SEP]B:So I have kind of a crazy idea. I&#x27;m curious what you&#x27;d think of this.[SEP]B:What if I let you into Denmark and I go for Sweden?[SEP]A:Well, if France goes for Holland I&#x27;d be in a slightly strategically worse position.[SEP]B:I was thinking you&#x27;d go from Kiel and bounce Holland with the HEL fleet. Then you get your build in Kiel[SEP]A:that wouldn&#x27;t work because I need kiel to support berlin, i think?[SEP]B:Is Munich occupied doing something else? Italy told me he has no plans of cutting support there.[SEP]B:Oh I guess Bur can do that though...[SEP]A:that was my fear...[SEP]B:Hmm... Yeah it may be safe to not do that then. Maybe next year. I may go for Sweden regardless. But if russia sees it coming and goes in, that could be a bit annoying[SEP]B:But without action, Russia probably takes Ank this fall and builds in Stp.[SEP]A:Is it worth losing the channel this turn? because you could take sweden for sure if you were willing to use nth to convoy[SEP]B:Nth can&#x27;t convoy to Sweden. SKA is in the way.[SEP]A:doesn&#x27;t need to. just convoy to norway and move your fleet from norway to sweden. then attack the baltic fleet from denmark. that way you don&#x27;t lose norway[SEP]B:BAL could move to sweden to bounce. only way to guarantee would be to support from Denmark[SEP]A:ah crap you&#x27;re right. sorry, wish I could help but all I have are land troops[SEP]B:No worries. I&#x27;ll give it a shot regardless. And if I do get the extra build, I can provide some serious support to your moves west[SEP]B:Things are getting a little rowdy haha. The good news is that we both outlasted Turkey![SEP]A:RIP.[SEP]B:go team![SEP]A:you held the channel! but no sweden yet...[SEP]B:Yeah. I think the bounce there will be a start of negotiations with Russia. Clearly we were both on the same page.[SEP]B:And you got holland back![SEP]A:ach but now there&#x27;s French in ruhr that&#x27;ll be a pain[SEP]B:A bit. France starts to crumble when I don&#x27;t have to support my fleet anymore, which is when Italy forces France to go south with its MAO fleet. Then I can start supporting your moves and we can get you into belgium, etc.[SEP]A:Are you gonna try for sweden again this season? France told me that they&#x27;re not moving their Mid-Atlantic fleet and instead would prefer to oust you from the channel. \\n\\nItaly gave me the idea of supporting your Welsh troops to convoy into Belgium. But if I did would you mind giving it to me in the Fall? I could be way more useful to you if I could build another unit this winter[SEP]A:(I told france I&#x27;d interrupt your support from Nth in exchange for France letting me take belgium next round, but at this point I almost don&#x27;t think of Belgium as being theirs to give, hence I&#x27;d rather work with you)[SEP]B:Russia and I plan to repeat the Sweden bounce. If that&#x27;s to be trusted, this frees up Kiel and Munich.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m happy to give you belgium. My idea of the split is you get Bel and Par, I get Bre and Por, and Italy gets Mar and Spa. Obviously this won&#x27;t all happen this year. But you in Bel makes sense long-term[SEP]B:The convoy makes me a bit nervous because if France goes to IRI, they&#x27;ll get a home supply center in the fall.[SEP]A:Okay, no convoy then. \\n\\nHow do you feel about reneging with Russia? If you moved into the baltic instead of bouncing and I moved into Denmark (this is also insurance in case I can&#x27;t end up with Belgium this year), I could support you into sweden in the fall?[SEP]B:I&#x27;d prefer to keep neutral with russia, as fighting a war on two fronts would be a lot for me. Belgium isn&#x27;t guaranteed for you this year, but I think it&#x27;s likely. France will have to respect the pressure in the south from Italy. This frees me up to cut support in Pic and support you in from Nth. Then you just have to cut support in Ruh and Bur (if there&#x27;s still something there in the fall).[SEP]A:If France is honest with me, Ruhr will be free and Bur will be occupied. \\n\\nLet&#x27;s be real here, though: Russia has at most two units to spare to threaten you, and likely not even that given the imminent pressure from Austria. I&#x27;m trying to work it out in the sandbox now but I really don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be an issue for you...[SEP]B:Russia can support into Norway once he&#x27;s in Sweden, and NTH won&#x27;t be free to stop that.[SEP]A:Okay that checks out. Thanks for your patience!\\n\\n...I was thinking of asking russia to support me into denmark this turn and offer to support them into sweden next season. I&#x27;m doing this a) to confirm for you that they&#x27;re on board with the bump as you say, and b) to show that I&#x27;d like to work to build trust with them. However, if Russia already knows you and I are working together this will establish the opposite of trust. So I guess I&#x27;m asking if you think this is a good/useful idea, and also asking what russia knows about our plans?[SEP]B:Russia can only suspect that we&#x27;re working together at this point. I haven&#x27;t given any indication of collaboration. I&#x27;d say ask away.[SEP]B:Are you definitely committed to not cutting support in Nth?[SEP]A:I really, really am. Maybe I&#x27;m just not creative enough, but because of my alliance with Italy, who is in turn strongly allied with Austria, I just don&#x27;t see myself ever getting anywhere in this game unless I can expand westward into France. Hence, even though you&#x27;re honestly scarier right now I&#x27;m inclined to be on your side for the foreseeable future. \\nNow, you could just go copy-paste this message to France and I&#x27;d be royally screwed, so I hope that helps you believe you can trust me.[SEP]B:Haha ok, glad to get the confirmation. On my end i’ll confirm I am totally anti-french until France is out of the game. I’ve actually ceased communications with France (maybe something we can all do once the stab is clear). I’d like all three of us to get our two builds each together. Then we can look east.[SEP]A:Russia&#x27;s loyal to you even in the face of my temptation, btw.[SEP]B:We’re in a great spot. Belgium for you is a guarantee. Planning to take from holland or ruhr?[SEP]A:Why do you ask? I assumed you were going to disrupt support from Picardy with a convoyed army while I disrupted Burgundy? That way you can still use Nth to support the channel in case France decides not to bother defending in the south[SEP]B:I’m a little worried that a clever france may let me into Pic, knowing that belgium is gone, and then move into IRI for invasion. I’d almost rather cut Pic with the channel and risk losing the channel. And my favorite option is to support ruh to bel from nth, also risking the channel. The logic is that if I lose the channel, it won’t be for very long, but if I lose a home supply center, that will be very annoying. France seems pretty upset with me, so a kamikaze move to screw me over isn’t out of the question.[SEP]A:Yeah, I&#x27;m getting that vibe from France too. Let&#x27;s go with moving me from Ruhr[SEP]B:Sounds good. Consistent with that theory, we’d advise italy to support into Spain instead of Mar. It’s a tough call though[SEP]A:I mean, not really. The way Italy&#x27;s positioned it seems like Spain is the only right call and that Marseilles will fall like a domino on a fault line next spring?\\n\\n...unless we could confirm that France really doesn&#x27;t intend to defend. Then Italy could potentially swipe both in one swoop. But even if France is saying such things to me (and they are) it&#x27;s still a risk[SEP]B:Marseilles isn&#x27;t guaranteed to fall next spring. Suppose Italy supports into Spa. France can block that supporting MAO from Gas. Suppose in the spring, Italy changes course and goes for Mar. France can then support Bur to Mar from Gas. Unless I&#x27;m missing something, it&#x27;s a guessing game until you&#x27;re in Bur.[SEP]A:God dammit. Just when I think I get this game, I’m still not clear on how the ‘coast’ thing works with fleets[SEP]A:Do you think I could trust Russia not to try to swipe Munich if I tried to take Bur this turn?[SEP]B:Yeah the territory can only be occupied by one unit regardless of coast. But a fleet must go to either the north or south coast. MAO can go to both. The coast matters if say you want to go from Spain to Mar. You can go there from the south coast, but not the north coast. And if you wanted to do this, you could coordinate a bounce with the Ber and Tyr armies so Russia can&#x27;t sneak in. You&#x27;re planning to sneak into Mun unsupported?[SEP]B:sneak into Bur*[SEP]A:well, at least to try for it. i hadnt thought of bumping with italy because i assumed tyr would move into pie[SEP]B:Well your move only works if we let Bur into Mar, which means Italy doesn&#x27;t try for Mar, which means pie would hold.[SEP]A:oh i thought italy was trying for spa? or rather, wherever italy decides to go there&#x27;s a chance it might work, and then they&#x27;d want someone in pie[SEP]B:We&#x27;ll have to see which move Italy wants to make. If Italy goes for Spa, the choice is between a hold or an attack from Pie. I would say a hold makes most sense for Italy if you&#x27;ve decided you&#x27;re going for Bur. This is because the alternative may be a bounce with Bur and Pie armies in Mar that would foil your plan to get to Bur and wouldn&#x27;t give Italy anything.[SEP]A:Okay that makes sense then.[SEP]A:As long as Italy doesn&#x27;t want to try to convoy into Spain from Pie. Then Marseilles could be left open *and* tyrolia could potentially move into piedmont[SEP]B:Yeah that could be an idea. Well, let me know when you hear from Italy. The good news is France will definitely be down one this year and maybe down two. And our progress will continue next year. At some point we should talk about post-war things.[SEP]A:Does post-war things mean how we&#x27;re going to deal with a seriously overpowered Austria/Italy?[SEP]B:Yeah. Though the move into Trieste by Italy is interesting. I&#x27;m actually starting to worry about collaboration with France. Would Italy really be so greedy as to start a war on two fronts? Also, had you asked for a hold in Pie? (not that it would have changed the outcome)[SEP]A:I asked but Italy told me that they couldn’t guarantee they would or wouldn’t, and I can understand wanting to keep that info need-to-know. But what makes you think Italy and France would collaborate?? Also, I’m not so sure you should read that seizing of trieste as an act of war; Italy *did* help Austria take two supply centers this turn. Austria might have given it willingly[SEP]A:*would or wouldn’t hold Pie[SEP]B:Austria expressed frustration to me about it. Also, Austria can&#x27;t build. All of its home supply centers are occupied. And Italy only helped with one supply center, right? And yeah the France theory may be a little paranoid, but why would Italy make an enemy out of Austria now while occupied with France?[SEP]B:What are your thoughts on the France campaign for this year?[SEP]B:Also, italy and austria’s stories about trieste don’t line up. Italy says it was an offering[SEP]A:Right that&#x27;s what Italy told me, too. So I&#x27;m not sure. Can I confront Italy with what Austria told you?\\n\\nI will be moving Kie-Ruh for sure.\\nWe can half-heartedly attack Pic this spring if you want (I&#x27;ll move Bel-Pic, you support), though I doubt we&#x27;ll get anywhere with it\\nMunich will support Kie-Ruh\\nAnd Fall I&#x27;ll do a three-sided assault on Bur. \\nNone of this is very exciting though. If Italy can&#x27;t make headway we&#x27;ll probably be stuck in a holding pattern until you can shift some resources from the baltic.[SEP]A:Actually, I got Italy on board to coordinate with us to leave one of Marseilles or Spain open for France to fall into. If you’re feeling adventurous, you could try for Mao, or if not I’ll try for Bur. Let me know which you prefer and we’ll talk plans[SEP]B:Italy is now saying that he told a secret that Austria didn&#x27;t want him to tell, and that I shouldn&#x27;t tell Austria that I know that Trieste was arranged... Sigh.[SEP]B:I&#x27;ll get back to you on MAO. Likely I won&#x27;t, but maybe with very friendly Russian disbands. Trying for Bur makes sense.[SEP]A:Well you couldn&#x27;t ask for friendlier disbands than that! What do you think about making a play for MAO? What if I could get Italy onboard to support you in from WES?[SEP]A:Also, I&#x27;m wondering what your thoughts are on taking Russia&#x27;s northern holdings. \\nOn the one hand, it&#x27;s more power for you, but on the other weakening Russia is pretty much the same as feeding Austria.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m nervous about MAO because I&#x27;d really like to keep holding the channel. Yeah I need to decide what to do with Russia. It&#x27;s really tempting to scoop up some supply centers, but that would be the end of Russia.[SEP]B:In other news, France (who continues to message in spite of my ghosting) just pointed out that Italy has a number 1 ranking on playdiplomacy.com. The username checks out, but that&#x27;s about as far as I can verify.[SEP]A:Right France told me too. So it may be worth reconsidering our deal with the devil[SEP]B:I think France may still have to go though. We can&#x27;t be both allied with France. Geographically it doesn&#x27;t really make sense. However, me you and Russia vs Austria and Italy might work well for us.[SEP]A:I think so too. But, realistically, as things stand now you, me, and Russia V. italy/austria just looks like me and russia getting sh*tkicked while you hang out in the back. So the question ought to be, can we afford to take down france before I/A get too powerful? Or is it worth it to put aside eating France to nip this in the bud?[SEP]B:Russia&#x27;s actually in a really good position if I choose not to invade. I&#x27;d have to go over the tactics, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that line will hold in the south.[SEP]B:And then you can support Mun from Kiel.[SEP]B:When the time comes[SEP]B:I can bring my fleets around this year to support the attack on France, and that would put us in good position to face italy. But we&#x27;d have to play it off as just going for France until France is gone.[SEP]A:but i thought you said you weren&#x27;t gonna go for MAO?[SEP]B:I won&#x27;t try from the channel. But I can bring the Nwy fleet around this year.[SEP]B:Why the fleet in berlin btw?[SEP]A:Well I figured that I&#x27;d need at least one more eventually, and that since my whole northern border is coastal a fleet might be better for defending that. But it&#x27;ll be all armies after this I think.[SEP]B:That makes sense, though it does seem like it will be stuck there for a while unless you start coming for me and russia[SEP]A:Well at some point we&#x27;ll all turn on each other, I assume. But I don&#x27;t see that happening for a while. Not til France Italy and Austria are dealt with[SEP]B:We can always play to a three way draw! So does this mean you would be committed to a Russia-Germany-England alliance until the others are dealt with?[SEP]B:And to a point you made a few messages ago about me hanging in the back: Dealing with Italy is going to take a lot from me. He&#x27;s got the fleets that only I can deal with.[SEP]A:Yes, that&#x27;s what this means. However, Italy and France are both pretty talkative with me these days which could be useful for us. So don&#x27;t go spreading it around that my true allegiance right now is to you and Russia.\\n \\nAnd speaking of fleet things: if you&#x27;re not doing anything with Nth this turn anyway, could you help me out by supporting Hol-Bel? I think it makes sense for me to have a fleet with channel access in case you ever need support or a bounce there to keep France out. Maybe some sunny day you&#x27;d even trust me to hold it for you, though I understand if not.[SEP]B:What sorts of things are you hearing from Italy and France? Also, are you talking to Russia? I&#x27;m planning to support the channel with Nth[SEP]A:I just messaged Russia. I told them about your suggestion of a three-way alliance, and that I was mainly focussed on attacking the west this year but if needed I could readjust to spare somebody to support in the east.\\n\\nI haven&#x27;t heard back from France yet, but I am sort of playing double-agent with Italy to ensure that France can continue countering Italy&#x27;s Spa/Mar plays and it just looks like luck. This keeps Italy in check until you and I make progress in the north and are better positioned to push Italy back.\\n\\nI should have mentioned, but a third reason for the fleet build last turn was to keep France&#x27;s trust. I figured it made sense anyway for the other two reasons I mentioned, but I did want to make sure France is willing to listen to me about Italy.[SEP]B:Interesting that Italy was willing to give up his guess to you. I had considered the idea of feeding France info like this, but he wouldn&#x27;t have believed anything I told him. And yeah it makes sense that something else was going on with the fleet situation.[SEP]B:What moves do you have planned westward?[SEP]A:Italy was willing to give up their guess because I requested that Marseilles be left open so I could take Bur, (which I plan to attempt w/ Munich this turn), and Italy agreed.[SEP]B:Did italy explain why he didn&#x27;t keep his end of the deal? Cause he moved to Mar[SEP]A:no I mean this turn[SEP]B:Ah ok. Cause we had talked about it last turn as well.[SEP]A:Last turn they didn&#x27;t give me anything useful[SEP]B:Gotcha. Italy had asked me for support into MAO, which would not be consistent with that though.[SEP]B:I did say no. Or rather haven&#x27;t said yes. I&#x27;m curious about the timing though.[SEP]A:Today at 5:11 PM, italy said to me: &quot;If I leave Marseilles open, would you kindly use Burgundy in the Fall to help me take Marseilles? (Likely that means ordering Burgundy to Gascony to cut support)&quot;. So, it could be that both are true and Italy plans to do *neither*--rather than try to take Spa, Italy&#x27;s gonna try rearranging?[SEP]A:*5:11 central time[SEP]B:Ok at 6:08 PM EST, italy asked about MAO. So that&#x27;s around the same time. I&#x27;m not going to support MAO and told Italy as much.[SEP]B:France would probably just cut in Bre anyways.[SEP]A:Was that the reasoning you gave for not supporting?[SEP]B:Just that it wouldn&#x27;t be fruitful because France would cut support. I also said that I was eyeing it for next year (which will be obvious from my upcoming move of the Nwy fleet)[SEP]A:Alright well sounds like we resolved that little mystery. Statecraft is exhausting.[SEP]B:Haha yeah. I don&#x27;t know if I would do online diplomacy again (I&#x27;ve only done it in person). I&#x27;ve spent wayy too much time thinking about this game. But it&#x27;s alson been fun[SEP]B:I&#x27;m prepping for an august in-person game I have scheduled with some friends[SEP]A:I have also been spending way too much time thinking about this! Yeah the days between adjudications are just too much.[SEP]B:I agree. In person is exhausting for other reasons though. You have to take a whole day out and it’s much more stressful when you have 15 minute negotiations and everyone is in the same house.[SEP]A:oh I didn&#x27;t even think of the logistics of in person negotiating! So if you and Russia disappear for five minutes everybody knows somethings up?[SEP]B:Yeah, and also you see little cliques start to form. Like three countries will get together and then go quiet when someone else walks in the room. And you can just shout stuff to the room if you want. Also tactical and order errors are more common. And intentional order errors are a thing.[SEP]A:That sounds like a perfect storm of social- and tactical-anxiety inducing stimuli. I think the ideal thing from my perspective would be online play with three adjudications per day. So it&#x27;s about the same level of commitment as a really active group chat.[SEP]B:Yeah people get pretty emotional. And I do it with a group of friends too. We decided we could only handle it once every 6 months or so.[SEP]B:three times a day would be too much for me I think. I feel like I wouldn&#x27;t get any work done.[SEP]A:I could see that. But sacrifices have to be made.[SEP]B:Haha I&#x27;m NOT a multitasker, so I&#x27;d bet the sacrifice is bigger for me than it is for you. Also, I feel like it would be easier almost if I wasn&#x27;t on the computer all day for work as it was. But having work and recreation competing for the same screen is really distracting for me.[SEP]A:you just described me. and my situation. But I take summers as pseudo-vacation so there&#x27;s not as much consequence[SEP]B:Yeah that&#x27;s not a bad way to do it. I&#x27;m a grad student in the same school/department as admin actually. So I&#x27;ve also got a pseudo-vacation not taking classes or anything, but I&#x27;m still trying to be productive.[SEP]A:I&#x27;m in admin&#x27;s department too! I should have realized: only grad students feel as guilty about spending time doing things they enjoy as you seem to 😛 \\nBut back to business: any chance of letting me borrow Denmark? I figure that with Northern Russia out of the picture your fleet&#x27;s just sort of...parked there. But if you let me have it I will either build an army in Ber to help out Russia or an army in Kiel to fight France with. I totally understand if you don&#x27;t want to, though.[SEP]A:Anyway, regardless of how you feel about the Denmark issue, I just hatched a plan to potentially help France keep resisting Italy, if you&#x27;re game:\\n\\nTell Italy you&#x27;ve had a change of heart and want to support them into MAO this turn, on the condition that they free it up for you by moving to Portugal next spring. \\nIf italy agrees, let me know. I&#x27;ll tell France to put all power into defending Marseilles and Mao. \\n\\nThe hope is that since last turn *I* was the one who knew Italy&#x27;s move and this time--as far as Italy knows--only *you&#x27;ll* know it, Italy won&#x27;t smell a rat when France is lucky in defending again[SEP]B:No way! I wonder if we&#x27;ve been walking past each other in Iribe and without any idea that we&#x27;re both in the study. And let&#x27;s bring up Denmark again when I have another build secured. Who knows how long it will take to get into Brest.[SEP]B:That&#x27;s a reasonable plan for Italy. Let me get a sense of where Italy&#x27;s head is at first. He may not even want MAO anymore.[SEP]B:Can you explain the fleet move btw?[SEP]A:Honestly because I thought you’d say yes to giving me Denmark.\\nI doubt we’ve run into each other because I’m in St Louis for the summer[SEP]B:Yeah, we should have talked about that before probably. On its own, the move has a somewhat anti-me connotation. And yeah I definitely have not been to St Louis this summer haha[SEP]B:You&#x27;re going for Bur this season?[SEP]A:Sorry to spook you! And not to beat a dead horse, but: you claim you want to secure another build, but with your denmark fleet basically stuck where it is, it’s not like keeping it is going to help you with that goal. That supply center’s doing nothing for you except maintaining the unit bound to it. *I* on the other hand, could help you get what you want by getting another build.\\n\\nIf you have plans to use the denmark fleet, I’ll respect them, because right now our goals are the same. But I see no point in keeping the fleet just for its own sake.\\n\\nYep, going for Bur[SEP]B:Yeah I mean it&#x27;s a bargaining chip. Russia has to be in my good graces while I have it. And it&#x27;s something I could offer you in exchange for something nice. It&#x27;s not clear to me why you need it right now. Paris has your name on it. You&#x27;ll win the eventual for Mar with no trouble.[SEP]A:Alright, that’s a valid reason.\\nI was feeling more urgent about it because I think it’s paramount that Russia get some aid against Austria.[SEP]B:Yeah that&#x27;s fair. I think Russia is clever enough to re-instate the stalemate, though. Maybe I&#x27;ll drop him a line to see what he&#x27;s thinking.[SEP]B:BTW italy plans to literally randomize his move choice.[SEP]A:Thanks for letting me know![SEP]B:Nice job on Bur. Let&#x27;s see if we can get you paris next year![SEP]A:What&#x27;s your plan for taking MAO? If you want to move Eng-IRI I will support Nth into the Channel?[SEP]B:Yeah i was thinking the same actually. Only risk is a bump in IRI i think results in dislodge of the current channel unit. I’m willing to risk it though. France at this point is likely trying to choose who to annoy the most as he goes down. I have a feeling it will be me, even though i’m not the one taking his territories so far. I’ll probably go another year without a build unfortunately[SEP]A:Patience, my tea-sipping friend 😛 \\nBut if you dislodge trying to get IRI that means you at least got Nao, and putting the unit in Pic would help you take Brest anyway[SEP]B:Oh i’m planning nwg to nth so that i’m still in nth. Do you think the brest fleet may move to Pic?[SEP]A:ya know, if you&#x27;d just let me have Denmark back you could keep Nth *and* get at least one of Nao/Iri/Brest this year.\\nI can keep talking to France to see where their head&#x27;s at, but I think a move to Pic is probably not in the cards. If you were to predict it France&#x27;d lose Brest![SEP]B:Are you still on good terms with France? Was the move into Bur expected?[SEP]A:It was, actually. France has seen the end coming for a while, but since I was willing to work with them against Italy while you two ghosted, they&#x27;re more amenable to my invasion that yours or Italy&#x27;s.[SEP]B:Makes sense. Well, let me think about whether Denmark is a possibility (though I’m still very hesitant) and get back to you. And I let me know what France is up to with Brest.[SEP]A:Alternatively, why not just leave Nth empty for a turn? \\nI&#x27;m working on figuring out France as we speak...[SEP]B:Cool. And I suppose I could, though it does leave me a little vulnerable. Maybe we could talk a bit about what our collaboration looks like over the next couple of years[SEP]A:Well, I can say definitively at this point that France prefers to mess with Italy over you. Basically they don&#x27;t want to see Italy totally dominate this game. I encouraged this by saying that Italy&#x27;s going to try for MAO this turn and they should focus on defending that. \\n\\nWrt the next couple years, my idea is this: it&#x27;s crucial that you take Mao, and that I take Paris. From here, you and I can work on beating Italy out of the Iberian, such that you end up with Portugal, Marseilles, and Spain and I end up with Brest and Paris (though you can have Brest at first). From here we&#x27;re well positioned to start hitting Italy on their home turf, esp. if Russia can keep hammering away at Austria[SEP]A:...any thoughts on this?[SEP]B:That all makes sense. Thought I&#x27;m a bit surprised that you&#x27;d rather have Brest than Mar. What&#x27;s the reasoning for that preference? And how long would you let me hold onto Brest?[SEP]A:I figured this split would give you land and sea options for attacking italy and not for attacking me. But I was just spitballing, and it may make more sense to divide it your way...And you could hold Brest until we were the only two in all of France and Spain, I suppose[SEP]A:have you made a decision yet about what to do about Nth?[SEP]B:I prefer to do the same moves as last time. So Nth would be a hold. I don&#x27;t think MAO is going to IRI or NAO. But you would have the inside scoop.[SEP]B:What would you do with Bel if it was freed up?[SEP]A:Wait when you say Nth is a hold, do you mean you *don&#x27;t* want to try for IRI like we talked about, and you&#x27;re just holding the channel?[SEP]B:That’s what i’m thinking now, yes[SEP]A:*just holding the channel and convoying to Brest?\\n\\nAnd if by &quot;it&quot; in &quot;what would you do with Bel if it was freed up?&quot;, you mean Nth, then probably move it to Pic in case France tries to bounce me out of Paris. But it might make more sense for you to just convoy to Pic, in which case Bel could support you into Pic[SEP]A:oh nevermind you mean &quot;what would you do with Bel if Bel wasn&#x27;t supporting Nth&quot;? Well, my answer still applies[SEP]A:...Would you like me to support your army into Pic?[SEP]B:That army isn’t leaving the island until france’s fate is sealed. Otherwise I open up my home centers to France.[SEP]A:but you did convoy to brest last time? Was that just because you were sure the army would bounce? \\n\\nSo then basically everyone&#x27;s holding still except you&#x27;re poking Nao?[SEP]B:Yeah that’s my plan. The convoy was because if it worked, I could just build on the island and be fine. But i’m taking on a risk if i can’t guarantee the build.[SEP]A:ohh gotcha. I&#x27;m moving Bur-Par, Ruh-Bur. Everyone else is just staying put[SEP]B:I really am curious about your relationship with France btw. Italy mentioned that you asked him recently whether collaboration with France was ok. But what could that mean unless it was against me?[SEP]A:🙄 Italy said that you were plotting against me, too! They&#x27;re just trying to make us suspicious of each other![SEP]B:So you’re saying italy lied to me? I’m gonna make you click that thumbs down if you’re trying to fool me here.[SEP]A:Well, no. It&#x27;s true that I asked Italy about collaborating with France, but only because France wanted us all to be able to talk about its last will and testament together. I didn&#x27;t bother asking you because you had been pretty clear on ghosting France, but I wasn&#x27;t sure whether Italy was or not til I asked[SEP]A:But it&#x27;s very possible that Italy took this fact and warped it to make you suspicious of me[SEP]A:So, while we&#x27;re at it, is there anything you might have said to Italy to indicate you were planning to turn on me?[SEP]B:Well i’m glad i asked the follow up question. Did italy agree to being part of this discussion? And how did the discussion turn out. Is France going to take out his anger on me with a final stab? Are you going to help him? And yeah i’ve absolutely been talking up anti-german things to italy. I want him to be confident in where i stand so he doesn’t expect a stab.[SEP]A:Oh italy said &quot;I don&#x27;t trust France&quot; and that was the end of it. So no, there didn&#x27;t end up being a discussion except me telling France that you&#x27;re gunning for Brest (which was obvious anyway), and that Italy&#x27;s shooting for Mao this turn (which may or may not be true--but by this time you and I were strategizing and I wanted to keep France out of our way). \\nIf france *is* planning to stab you, they&#x27;re intentionally throwing me off the scent. Which would be surprising but not unheard of. So no, I&#x27;m not planning to help in a stab I know nothing about.[SEP]A:Well, to be clear, another consequence of my and France&#x27;s conversation was that France is just letting me walk into Paris this turn (unless they&#x27;re gonna stab me but I doubt it)[SEP]B:Yeah i believe that. So i guess it’s just giving italy a hard time then, or maybe some unexpected movement north. Has italy talked to you about attacking me?[SEP]B:Post-france?[SEP]A:Well yeah. In the same convo where they said you were plotting to stab me they gave some reasons why it&#x27;s better for me to side with them than with you. So no specifics but Italy clearly wants us against each other. But I don&#x27;t think either of us stand a chance if we fall for that.[SEP]A:*no specific attacks were suggested, I mean[SEP]B:Gotcha. Well i think we have to acknowledge that our alliance would be sort of geographically awkward. I think that makes the alliance stronger actually, but we should be honest with each other about an exit that gives each of us a fair shot in the endgame.[SEP]A:okay...well, as the person who has ever seen an endgame before, what do *you* suggest?[SEP]B:I think we agree to coordinated actions until italy is dealt with. I think you in brest is actually more fair, although less ideal for me. I think we need to pick a victor of the russian-austrian war. Austria is an easier pick because i can take russian dots and austria can help with italy.[SEP]A:Alright. But it will be harder to flip Austria against Italy, I think.[SEP]B:Nah, i’ve been working on it a bit, and it’s only natural once his current conflict is mitigated somewhat[SEP]B:I think between us we should find a split of dots we feel comfortable with. Not that it can’t change in future negotiations. But i think it’s easier to stay friends when the end seems fair from the get-go[SEP]B:We don’t have to do this tonight, but soon.[SEP]A:Okay, soon. Glad we had this talk 😃[SEP]B:Fwiw i’m a relative first-timer too. I’ve played two or three times in person, and the first time we didn’t finish. I think everyone else plays a lot more. Would be nice to make this an underdog story.[SEP]B:Regardless of which way it falls in the end.[SEP]A:I think so, too. And Italy is like the over-est of dogs.[SEP]B:You lost me haha. The over-est of dogs?[SEP]A:like, the opposite of underdog would be overdog. And Italy is the most over-est overdog there is.[SEP]A:*the overwolf, perhaps[SEP]B:Haha gotcha. Do we think he’s actually the number 1 guy like france said? He denied it to me. But the username lines up.[SEP]A:I think it&#x27;s more probable than not. Although, I also think it&#x27;s really unfair to have that information leaked when other players get the benefit of a clean slate. That said, just looking at the way Italy moves and talks it&#x27;s clear that they know what they&#x27;re doing[SEP]B:Yeah he’s definitely a good player. All the better when we take him down.[SEP]A:ugh I really wish everyone&#x27;d stop using *he* all the time. France and Italy know each other from outside this game, but it irks me that &quot;he&quot; seems to be the default. Out of curiosity, do you/others use &quot;she&quot; when referring to me?[SEP]B:I had been using “they”, but then i stopped once i saw other people using gendered pronouns. My rationalization was that the other players must have been confident in their correctness to start using them, but obviously that’s not true. We use “she” for you. France said it to me first i think. Happy to commit to being gender neutral in future negotiations (with all players)[SEP]A:I didn’t mean to be directive—it doesn’t matter that much to me, but it makes me feel better if I know people aren’t just doing it mindlessly, and are actually matching it to players they know. I never specified to France that I use “she” but my username is feminine so it was a fair assumption.[SEP]B:Yeah that’s totally fair. I will admit I had floated the idea of trying to play feminine and flirt with one of the probably straight male players to gain favor. The username’s a giveaway though. And that might be taking things too far haha.[SEP]A:That can’t possibly actually work, can it? The flirting, I mean. This is a serious game for serious-minded individuals 😛[SEP]B:...”, she writes, before adding a playful emoji at the end.[SEP]B:All’s fair in love, war, and diplomacy 😉[SEP]B:Ouch! Still open to collaboration, but we’ve got some trust building to do[SEP]A:I wasn&#x27;t sensing any trust from you, either: you were unwilling to return Denmark or to leave Nth empty, and you&#x27;re right about our alliance being geographically awkward. \\n\\nI want to be a good ally with you, but the difference between you and me is that you get a cozy corner of the map and I&#x27;m right in the middle. I need to be able to grow my army to defend all my various borders. So I&#x27;m asking for Denmark a little less politely.[SEP]B:Well now you&#x27;ve seen me make exactly the moves that I said I would, so hopefully you have some trust in me. I see what you mean about the cozy corner, but coziness has its disadvantages as well. Once somebody gets on the island, it&#x27;s a really bad time. And I need fleets or convoys of armies to get anywhere off the island. Makes expansion difficult.[SEP]B:As far as denmark, the aggression there is fair. But you understand why I&#x27;m hesitant to drop down to 4 dots at this point in the game. Fortunately, there&#x27;s an opportunity to do business here now that you&#x27;re adjacent to Brest.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m definitely a bit upset about the support into the channel you gave and all of the lying. You didn&#x27;t need to lie about your moves to amp up the aggression on denmark: I never asked for a full list of moves.[SEP]A:That&#x27;s true, I was overcompensating because it really seemed like your trust in me was low.[SEP]B:Well, it&#x27;s a vicious cycle. Mistrust breeds mistrust. So how can I trust now that you&#x27;re not just going to continue working with France on an invasion?[SEP]A:Because France is literally about to not exist, for one. And for another, because Italy is planning something that will be bad for both of us.[SEP]B:Planning something specific that you know about?[SEP]A:Yes. But I was told specifically not to tell you so I need you to not mention it to any other players. I know that&#x27;s a hard sell coming from me, but I need you to promise.[SEP]B:Alright. It’s a promise. Who’s the info from?[SEP]A:Doubly confirmed by France and Italy. They&#x27;ve reached an agreement to give Italy the channel. When I confronted Italy about it, Italy said they wouldn&#x27;t do it if I didn&#x27;t want them to, but also admitted that they wouldn&#x27;t have told me about it if I hadn&#x27;t asked.[SEP]A:But France also told me they would reneg on Italy if I asked. So, on the one hand, I could tell italy to call it off and things could proceed some unknown way. On the other, I could get France to reneg, and the three of us could turn this to our advantage. What do you think?[SEP]B:It’s certainly possible this is true. Though italy had told me he was actively deceiving France into getting the brest unit to do something unusual[SEP]B:So if Italy is truly going for the channel, he went so far as to cover his tracks by warning me he may have suggested something like this to France[SEP]B:To what extent has italy communicated plans of an alliance with you?[SEP]A:I mean that doesn&#x27;t seem out of the question for Italy. Italy has told me point blank that if it&#x27;s a choice between you or me, they&#x27;d choose me. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve said the same to you.[SEP]B:Did he give any reasoning for that choice?[SEP]A:Some bull about how I&#x27;m an honest communicator. That raised a red flag for me because Italy&#x27;s too smart to need honesty from me. You&#x27;re the better strategic choice. \\n\\nSo, it&#x27;s entirely possible that Italy fed me this plot through France as some kind of ploy. And even that the two of you are already working closely together to ruin me, although I do hope that&#x27;s not the case.[SEP]B:I agree with all that. I’m just trying to tease out who he’s lying to, as that may provide some advantage. Honestly he’s been more pro-English than anti-German in his communications with me. I think he maybe just doesn’t want me to go tattle to you though.[SEP]B:So what moves would you want to see from me this fall?[SEP]A:I&#x27;ll tell Italy the deal is off, then you move Den-Nth, Nth-Eng (supported by Bel), Eng-Bre (supported by Paris). Mao will take Portugal and you&#x27;ll take Mao? I know you&#x27;ll have to trust my support in two places, but it&#x27;s worth it to me to get two builds this turn without a fuss and keep Italy localized to the south.[SEP]B:Did italy tell you MAO would take Portugal?[SEP]A:No. I haven&#x27;t given them my opinion on the channel deal yet. But that would be what I&#x27;d suggest they do instead[SEP]B:Alright. Would you be able to confirm that this is where MAO would go before I agree to a deal?[SEP]A:I just sent Italy a message about it, so I&#x27;ll see what they say.[SEP]A:What has Italy been saying to you lately, by the way?[SEP]B:He suggested some defensive tactics to me.[SEP]A:Defensives against me? in Denmark? Or France in Iri? Or both?[SEP]B:Both. He’s under the impression that we are not friendly after those last moves. I don’t plan to take his suggestion though[SEP]A:I&#x27;m wondering if these defenses involve you not supporting Eng, which would kind of half-confirm the plot.[SEP]B:They do involve me not supporting Eng.[SEP]A:Italy said they are busy this weekend (hard for me to imagine people having a life, but it must be so) and won&#x27;t get back to me til monday.[SEP]B:Gotcha. I’m playin dnd this weekend, but i’m not sure that quite counts as having a life). I’ll probably be mostly offline through sunday evening just cause i really need a break from this game[SEP]B:Umm the plan doesn&#x27;t work btw. Gas is just going to cut the Par support that you promised me (this is the only useful thing it can do). So, no deal, unfortunately. I&#x27;ll see if I can get last minute support in from Italy and let you know.[SEP]A:I really don&#x27;t think an attack from Gascony would be an issue, but I understand that your trust in France is much lower than mine. We could still work together somehow, though?[SEP]B:In a tactical sense, anything else from Gascony would be a misfire. So not cutting the Paris support is just giving up Brest. I really don&#x27;t think France is just going to hand Brest to me. I&#x27;m still waiting to see if I can get Italian support, in which case we&#x27;re back in business. The alternative would be a more defensive move on my part (i really don&#x27;t want to go down to 4 dots at this phase in the game).[SEP]B:Ok. Hope you&#x27;ll see this before noon. Italy has agreed to support into Bre. I also require Par support for this to go through. Do you agree to provide Par supports channel to Bre and Bel supports Nth to Channel? I will vacate Denmark if so[SEP]B:Ok, well if I don&#x27;t hear from you in the next couple of minutes, I won&#x27;t assume the support and will play defensive.[SEP]A:Sorry I&#x27;m trying to get verification from Italy but they&#x27;re not responding. That&#x27;s a good default plan[SEP]B:I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to get verification from Italy. Italy is online and talking to me though.[SEP]B:Ok do I have your supports?[SEP]A:Yes[SEP]A:Deal on![SEP]B:Yep, Denmark going to Nth.[SEP]A:got Italy confirmation...hope this goes through[SEP]B:drum roll......[SEP]B:Yay![SEP]A:wow an 11th-hour three-power deal (with a decieved france as a fourth) that actually went through as planned![SEP]B:Yeah. And although we had our hiccups, this was really about as good as we could have hoped the takedown to be from the beginning.[SEP]A:do you think there&#x27;s a chance Italy would give you Mao willingly this turn?[SEP]B:There&#x27;s a chance. I&#x27;m surprised by the fleet build btw.[SEP]A:My plan is to eventually have only fleets along my northwest coast (they&#x27;re more versatile in that context) and move the armies inland. \\n\\nSee what you can negotiate with Italy, but no matter what they say, I&#x27;d be prepared to use your full strength to get Nao into Mao, if that&#x27;s what you want to do. (And in case it&#x27;s not obvious, it&#x27;s what *I* think you should do)[SEP]A:To that end, I can support Eng and Bre holding.[SEP]B:I appreciate the supports. Any idea what trouble France will be trying to cause?[SEP]B:I imagine you&#x27;ll get a request about Bre.[SEP]A:France and Italy are probably not working together after last year&#x27;s stab. But France has asked me if there&#x27;s anything I want Pic to help with. So depending on your plans I *may* be able to push some help your way. I feel like Italy&#x27;s 10 units kind of speak for themselves, so even though you and F have had your differences there&#x27;s a good chance F will want to help you/us as the underdogs[SEP]B:Yeah I mean this turn I don&#x27;t know what Pic does to help me. Anti-Italian moves are MAO as you&#x27;ve described. What are your thoughts on supporting Bre to Gas from Par? This would require a lot of trust from you, but would make supporting into Spa possible in the fall.[SEP]A:Does that mean you&#x27;d convoy into Bre? Because I can ask France to support that![SEP]A:But it would also mean you don&#x27;t take a shot at Mao this turn, which is something I&#x27;d want to see.[SEP]B:In this plan, I leave Bre open. I suppose that&#x27;s too great a risk with France there?[SEP]A:Well, especially if I&#x27;m asking for France&#x27;s help, yeah. But even without revealing the plan, I still think it&#x27;s a risk.[SEP]B:Could you ask france for support into the channel maybe?[SEP]B:Or say that you&#x27;ll support France in?[SEP]A:hmmm that could work! Then we only have to trust that Italy won&#x27;t try and take Brest. Which isn&#x27;t too far fetched since they *just* helped you take it[SEP]B:Hmm, no there&#x27;s an issue with the retreat if I dislodge MAO.[SEP]B:Here&#x27;s an idea. Tell France you&#x27;re supporting Pic to Bre. Then just bounce Par in Bre.[SEP]A:Elegant. I like it.[SEP]B:Italy goes to IRI, but I can defend with the wales army[SEP]B:Any thoughts on Russia btw? I imagine Swe is tempting[SEP]A:It *is* tempting, but I&#x27;m not trying to fight Italy and Russia at the same time. And Russia&#x27;s been pretty honest with me. So I&#x27;ll leave it for now.[SEP]B:That&#x27;s fair. Any intel on italy btw? Where do your relations stand?[SEP]A:Italy doesn&#x27;t tell me anything unless they have something to gain from me. I asked if they were going to try and take the channel again and they denied it, but that could be fake news?[SEP]B:Take it with French support? Otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t make sense[SEP]B:Well, I suppose I&#x27;m comfortable that Italy sees me as a friend on the board.[SEP]A:You&#x27;re right that *if* italy were to try that again, it would take a lot of negotiating to get France&#x27;s favor. So probably you&#x27;re right to not be concerned.[SEP]B:Alright. I’ll be somewhat not available this evening, so can you confirm moves to make sure we’re on the same page?[SEP]A:Paris supports Bre-Gas, Bel supports Eng holding, Ber-Mun, Mun-Bur[SEP]A:WAIT NO (sorry I was making pie and lost track of this game): I&#x27;m waiting on confirmation from France about Pic-Bre, which I will bounce with Par-Bre[SEP]B:making piedmont?[SEP]B:And no worries[SEP]A:haha I wish[SEP]A:peach piedmont[SEP]B:Sounds delicious[SEP]A:France confirmed the move to Bre so the plan is a-go[SEP]B:Ouch again! Care to have a chat?[SEP]A:well you weren&#x27;t exactly truthful either![SEP]A:I think we may need to face the fact that we&#x27;re just not a good match[SEP]B:I suppose you’re not interested in what I have to say then?[SEP]A:No I am. Alls i’m saying is that we should both be taking grains of salt with each others’ words[SEP]B:Yeah that’s fair. With what i’m about to disclose, regardless of whether you believe it or use the knowledge against me, I would ask that it be confidential from anyone else on the board (including the fact that I’m asking for this confidentiality). I know you’ve sent plenty of lies my way, but if you agree i’d really like it to be the truth this time.[SEP]A:I promise not to mention it to anyone else; let’s hear it[SEP]B:Ok just to be really specific about it: Can we agree on the story that we ceased communications. You said we’re not a good match and I said “suit yourself” and that was it? And can we also promise to not make the communication obvious without saying it exactly (e.g. “someone told me xyz” when only I could have known). And to be clear i’m agreeing to the confidentiality as well.[SEP]A:Okay, sure. But there’s something I want to know (and I’ll keep my agreement now no matter what the answer):\\nDid you in any way indicate to Italy that you knew/suspected the channel plot last year?[SEP]B:No, he revealed the channel plot to me without me asking[SEP]B:This was after you told me about it[SEP]A:Well that makes no sense, because after I revealed it to you, Italy reiterated to me that they really did not want you to know about it.[SEP]B:I think Italy wanted to be the one to tell me so he would keep my trust. I’d have to look to see whether this was revealed before or after Brest went through, but I know at least that before Brest I was confident he wasn’t going for the channel.[SEP]A:Well anyway, what did you want to tell me? It stays between us, guaranteed, but I would reserve the right to move according to this information if I think it necessary[SEP]B:Yeah that&#x27;s totally fine. So last night I made a deal with the devil. One that he couldn&#x27;t refuse. It&#x27;s a lie that I will uphold it, but I think it&#x27;s a convincing one.[SEP]A:Okay, go on[SEP]B:I told italy I would do everything in my power to get him the game. In exchange I asked to 1) be kept alive until the end and 2) get tips from him on how to play the game before my upcoming in-person game. I told him that MY win is about getting the best experience from this game so that I&#x27;m prepared for the in-person game (this is kind of true).[SEP]B:Since then he&#x27;s told me some pretty interesting things. I&#x27;ll send you some quotes.[SEP]B:&quot;that thing France said about my past successes: that was true. I do have a lot of experience and I have had a fair amount of success playing online diplomacy. I just did not want you thinking of me that way.&quot;[SEP]B:&quot;I’ll also note, just cause I have nobody else to talk with about this: I worked REALLY hard on this last move. Germany wanted to take Brest, but if that happened, it would have cut support and prevented your army from leaving your island. So I had to convince Germany to support France to Brest, without telling her the real reason why. And I needed you to go to NAO so that you could not guard Liverpool. There were so many lies!&quot;[SEP]B:&quot;To be completely honest, I directed just about everyone else’s moves on that turn! Russia is the one exception, but I basically knew what he was going to do. The best advice I have for someone who wants to get better at Diplomacy: just work hard. You can win by putting in more time and effort than everyone else. I have success by writing a lot to everyone all the time.&quot;[SEP]B:&quot;I’m not going to lie about my moves to someone unless I am going to get a huge advantage out of it. But I spend most of the game trying to make everyone else on the board feel that I’m their closest ally, so a lot of what I say is a shade on the truth.&quot;[SEP]B:That&#x27;s what I got.[SEP]B:And if italy continues to talk this way, I might have more to share, and would be happy to share it.[SEP]A:Damn that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for sharing!\\nDid he say why he was so keen to have your army on the mainland?[SEP]B:It&#x27;s so it&#x27;s not on the homeland.[SEP]A:I’m surprised you were willing to do that. Why?[SEP]B:Italy promised me Paris. You were going to go to Nth from Bel, and then France was going to retreat to Bel.[SEP]A:Oh so italy screwed you! \\nHe’ll do the same to me when the time comes. \\n...would you be willing to give me some warning of when that is, if you’re involved in it? Ya know, just for the fun of sticking it to a master manipulator?[SEP]B:I&#x27;d obviously prefer something a bit more collaborative than that. Italy will be at 12 SUPPLY CENTERS this fall. I&#x27;m not giving up on a mutually beneficial relationship here. Especially given that I may have some inside scoop from Italy for a while.[SEP]B:13 if I help him into Brest.[SEP]A:Well look, England, given that Italy or you could be talking crap at any moment, I see taking your supply centers as a more certain path to my survival than having your/his information. If you are actively going to help him take supply centers, then at best you’re surviving at the expense of making an enemy of everyone, because you’d be italy’s dog, not his ally. It’s your choice, though.[SEP]B:I&#x27;ve not lied to you once this game. You can check the record with admin after if you&#x27;re curious. Have I deceived you? Certainly. But I&#x27;ve not made explicit agreement to moves that I didn&#x27;t follow through with. That includes Denmark (we had discussed strategy, and I said I&#x27;d confirm moves in the morning, and then I just never did, which I know was shitty). So I just want to be clear on that.[SEP]A:Don’t quibble semantics with me! Deception’s deception and we’re *both* guilty of it. If anything, it makes me trust you less if you think mere technicality gives you the moral high ground here[SEP]B:I&#x27;m not asking for moral high ground. I&#x27;m giving you my knowledge that my deception to you has historically taken the form of truth. If we work on being more explicit with our agreements, I think we can build trust there.[SEP]B:And regardless of whether I&#x27;m italy&#x27;s dog, I wouldn&#x27;t be so sure of getting my supply centers. I can defend everything this year, and I may be able to hold you off next year as well. At that point, Italy&#x27;s fleets may be in position to push you off the island.[SEP]B:What I can&#x27;t defend is Italy taking Liverpool.[SEP]A:You can if you retreat to Edi?[SEP]A:At least for this year[SEP]B:No I can retreat to Skag if I want. I can bounce Edi from NWG and bounce london from the channel.[SEP]A:So you&#x27;re not saying you *cant* defend liverpool, just that you&#x27;d prefer not to. *Now* who&#x27;s using imprecise language 😛[SEP]B:No I can&#x27;t. Italy is in MAO. My army is not on the island. He can get there in one move and I can&#x27;t.[SEP]B:NAO*[SEP]A:you *can* if you retreat to Edi![SEP]A:or york even[SEP]B:Oh wow you&#x27;re right. That was dumb. Yes I can.[SEP]B:York doesn&#x27;t work because the move is illegal. Can&#x27;t go around the coast like that.[SEP]B:Oh and actually I was right. Edi applies in the same way[SEP]B:Cly is in the way. Fleets have to move along the coast.[SEP]A:wait, I&#x27;m confused. What? The unit displaced from Nth. You haven&#x27;t given retreat orders yet. Go to Edi?[SEP]A:Ohhhhhhh of course[SEP]B:A fleet in Edi can&#x27;t go to Lvp. An army could, but a fleet can&#x27;t[SEP]B:Yeah, you got it.[SEP]B:That confused me for a second too.[SEP]B:So if you&#x27;re willing to collaborate, I&#x27;ve got some ideas, and would want to hear yours as well. I genuinely think working with me against Italy will be a better long-term strategy for you than working against Italy or alone. Italy is just too strong already. And, as I&#x27;ve said before, I&#x27;d like to see an underdog story.[SEP]B:right now my retreat is to Skag, which will not raise any alarms on Italy&#x27;s end. Is this alright with you or would you like to see something different?[SEP]B:working with italy or alone*** for two messages ago[SEP]B:updated to Nwy. More friendly to you.[SEP]A:Well, that means a lot. \\n...I take back what I said about wanting all your dots. I&#x27;m waiting for Italy to get back to me about strategy for this turn, and when he does I&#x27;ll get back to you with what counter plan I can offer. I think this is going to be a turning point where I either commit fully against you or commit fully with you, and it hinges on what Italy is planning. Just know that I&#x27;m not going to offer a plan to you unless it&#x27;s a real one. No contract-law trickery, no outright deceit. And if you don&#x27;t hear from me, well, it&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve *both* chosen the devil and our own glorious undoing at his hands[SEP]B:Haha, this is fair. Best of luck in negotiations. Regardless of what you choose, I commit to offering you any counter-Italy intel I can gather.[SEP]B:Would you be willing to also hear a plan offer from me?[SEP]A:I am. And it stays between us, of course.[SEP]B:So, broadly speaking, the alliance would involve Austria. And that means moving against Russia. We have a huge advantage going into Russia, which takes pressure off of Austria and allows austria to put pressure on Italy.[SEP]A:Alright--haha I was just in a sandbox ordering you to move to sweden anyway 😃[SEP]B:Hmm, you might lose Munich this year though.[SEP]A:This has been noted.[SEP]B:No specific intel there, just saying tactically it&#x27;s a possibility. I don&#x27;t know if italy would go for that. I mean we had discussed someone going to munich before his stab, but I don&#x27;t know if that can be trusted[SEP]A:Well before you and I started chatting Italy denied that he had any plans for munich this season, but his word isn&#x27;t exactly his bond[SEP]B:Yeah, not sure what he&#x27;ll do there. It may be in his interest to remain neutral. Certainly if he catches any wind of what&#x27;s going on, Munich is vulnerable. Maybe something to consider in setting up next year[SEP]B:We get to choose what happens in Brest, which is great. And then the tricky bit is figuring out how to kick Italy off the island[SEP]A:mhm. I was sort of depending on getting a build this turn, such that I&#x27;d have someone around to defend Mun. So I would be sacrificing that by working with you. I can convoy Holland to York?[SEP]B:Let&#x27;s get you in Brest then.[SEP]A:You&#x27;d still have to dissolve somebody, then[SEP]B:Go down to 4, sure. But if I go to sweden I stay at 4.[SEP]B:I would like your help getting liverpool back if you convoy there, as opposed to having you take it. However, your army will be a little precarious on the island and will need a way off.[SEP]B:convoy to yor*[SEP]B:the threat of MAO to IRI will be a pain, but I think we can manage.[SEP]A:Right--I wouldn&#x27;t expect to get to take it (liverpool) if you&#x27;re handing me Brest. \\nAnd if Italy and I &quot;agree&quot; to a plan where he does some supporting from Mao, and he says nothing to you to contradict that plan, would you take that as enough proof that IRI is safe?[SEP]B:Yeah, that makes sense. I&#x27;ll let you know anything I hear from him. He&#x27;s been quiet this morning. Ok I need to sign off for like a while to get work done. My fall moves under this plan will be Nwy to Swe, NWG to either Edi or Cly, Pic and Eng support Par to Bre,[SEP]A:I think the plan I have in the works might be better than yours, so I&#x27;ll get back to you later![SEP]B:Haha alright. Better for you or better for both of us?[SEP]A:Worse for italy, equally good for me, potentially better for you.[SEP]B:Alright, I&#x27;ll be happy to hear it.[SEP]B:New confidential italy quote: &quot;I suggest that you take Sweden, and I’m working on getting Belgium this turn too. It’ll be tricky to keep Germany from defending it, but I’m going to try.&quot;[SEP]A:Did he have anything to say about you retreating to norway instead of skag?[SEP]B:He was surprised, but not upset. I said my justification was that it was going to Sweden anyways and that I wanted to warm things up with Germany. Did you hear anything?[SEP]A:Italy only just responded to me, so nothing yet.[SEP]A:Still nothing from Italy, but if we *were* to have a plan, I think it should be this:\\n\\nEng s Bre-Mao, Bre-Mao, Pic-Bre, Par-Gas, Bur s Par-Gas, Nwy-Swe, Nwg-Cly, Nth c Hol-Edi[SEP]A:Your promptness in reporting Italy&#x27;s words to me plays to your advantage: if the next message from italy to me suggests I do something that leaves Belgium vulnerable, I&#x27;ll pretty much be so revolted that I&#x27;ll have no choice but to stab him[SEP]B:Will continue to send things your way, though I’m not sure how much more i’ll hear. How come you prefer Edi to Bre? Your proposition seems to leave me more vulnerable.[SEP]B:Also, thoughts on messaging to France? I’m thinking I’ll ask Italy what he wants me to say, and I’ll say that. I’ll also tell you what I say[SEP]A:Ugh I *knew* you&#x27;d say that. (The vulnerability thing). Note the plan also leaves Paris wide open. We need to *trust* each other. But it makes more sense for Paris to move to Gascony to put some pressure on or--dare I dream it--take marseilles and the southern holdings. Since France might go poof next near it is better for *me* to be there.[SEP]A:And in order to help your ouster from liverpool I needed somebody on the island anyway. You&#x27;re pretty much equally vulnerable whether they&#x27;re in york or edi[SEP]A:As for French messaging, I&#x27;m not really sure. I only just messaged them for the first time this season (they asked me first what I&#x27;d like them to do), telling them basically what I&#x27;ve told you (that I stand at the crossroads of either playing Italy&#x27;s game or fighting back with your help). I&#x27;m waiting to hear which they think I should do. If you want to urge them to help our plot, that&#x27;s your prerogative.[SEP]B:France was expressing anti-Italian sentiments to me. Italy told me to respond anti-Italian, so that’s what i’ll do. My thought about Edi is that if you were to go to york and the rest of the plan stays the same, we get another unit to fight with. I could build an army in Edi, for example. Do you feel like you need Edi as collateral? I’m with you all the way on this plan, so i’m willing to be flexible, but I do like to understand what you’re thinking.[SEP]A:Same as I was thinking before: I need a build so someone&#x27;s around to defend Munich. you were willing to part with Brest and let me into york, so I don&#x27;t see why parting with Edi (temporarily!!) is really all that different[SEP]B:Alright. Can we agree on when I get it back? And how confident are you in holding Mun this year?[SEP]B:This just in from Italy: &quot;France is ordering Brest to Channel. Germany is ordering Burg S Bel and convoying Holland to Yorkshire....!&quot;[SEP]B:And the follow-up: &quot;So here is the move: Norway - Swe, Pic S Channel - Belgium, Mar - Bur to cut support, Gas to Bre to block the Paris move. &quot;[SEP]A:Italy&#x27;s playing us both, you can believe that. He fed me the moves you specified, then turned around and fed them to you. He only gains by playing off both of us. Well, fuck &#x27;em.[SEP]A:sorry for swearing.[SEP]B:No swearing is fine if it&#x27;s against Italy. Have you made your decision then?[SEP]B:And I&#x27;m a little confused about what you mean by sending us both the same moves.[SEP]A:I mean he said &quot;here&#x27;s what I suggest: [the moves you sent me just now]&quot; and I said &quot;okay sure!&quot; because deception is important in this game, i&#x27;m told. Then he told you the moves, then you told them to me! \\nBut because he suggested leaving Bel undefended and you *warned* me about it, I had made up my mind in that moment.[SEP]B:Gotcha. So we&#x27;re both sworn to take down Italy? I certainly am.[SEP]B:I also have a bad feeling you&#x27;ll be losing Mun this turn. Have you talked to Russia about it?[SEP]B:I&#x27;m going tell Italy I agree to the proposition. Sound good?[SEP]A:He&#x27;s as slimy as spaghetti al&#x27;olio and he needs to be knocked down a peg. Plan on!\\n\\nThere&#x27;s nothing whatsoever I can offer russia right now. So no, I didn&#x27;t bother talking to them about it. Either it happens or it doesn&#x27;t, far as I&#x27;m concerned[SEP]A:And yes please tell Italy you agree to those moves. I love a good surprise.[SEP]A:*okay to be clear plan is not on til I hear back from France. But *I&#x27;m* on board.[SEP]B:Plan is not on, but working together against Italy definitely on?[SEP]A:On like beans on an English breakfast plate[SEP]B:Ok, I&#x27;m going to take your word for it that English breakfast has beans[SEP]B:What do you think about Par support Bre to Gas?[SEP]B:If I get into Bre, this will leave Gas vacant. The planned Bur support of Par won&#x27;t go through based on Italy&#x27;s moves[SEP]B:From italy: &quot;Germany is now fishing for info from me about our relationship. Does she know that we are still talking? I’d like to tell her that you’re mad at me and you will tell me nothing, but we must keep our stories straight.&quot;[SEP]A:All I said was &quot;Do you know anything about what England&#x27;s planning?&quot; so he has no idea we talk[SEP]A:I just wanted to see if he&#x27;d be honest with me. Of course he&#x27;s covering his ass by asking you first.[SEP]B:Yeah I believe it. I&#x27;m going to respond and say that we shored up discussions this morning (which is what we originally planned the story to be)[SEP]A:wait I thought &#x27;shored up&#x27; meant &#x27;repaired or fortified&#x27;? do you mean like &#x27;shuttered discussions&#x27;?[SEP]B:Oh you&#x27;re probably right. I should work on my idioms[SEP]B:I mean that you basically said &quot;I don&#x27;t think we can be good allies&quot;, and I was like &quot;But, but.... &quot; and you didn&#x27;t get back to me[SEP]A:lol so I&#x27;ll make sure not to use the same idiom as you if Italy asks *me* if you and I talk![SEP]A:yep that&#x27;s the story[SEP]B:My reply: &quot;No, but I&#x27;d bet she&#x27;d assume it. We didn&#x27;t have much to say to each other this morning. I tried to be friendly but she was kinda straight up about saying that an alliance wasn&#x27;t going to work out. And I sent a message back but haven&#x27;t heard anything. So I&#x27;d imagine she&#x27;d think I&#x27;m not just sitting here twiddling my thumbs. Up to you how to spin it though.&quot;[SEP]A:Oh, and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll spin me something pretty, all right.[SEP]B:Yeah, we&#x27;ll see. And the Bre to Gas move I brought up? (repeating so it doesn&#x27;t get buried)[SEP]A:If we can trust Italy&#x27;s reported moves, it&#x27;s the right call. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s our best option.\\n\\n...and something that *did* get buried: I&#x27;m willing to move out of Edi during the upcoming fall. I&#x27;ll dissolve my Nth fleet since its only real purpose was stabbing you anyway[SEP]B:Perfect. And who gets Lvp next fall?[SEP]B:And do you think France will do the move? I&#x27;d rather you suggest it so I keep a low profile.[SEP]A:I still haven&#x27;t heard from France. And we already agreed that you take liverpool.[SEP]B:Ok great. I didn&#x27;t remember if we&#x27;d explicitly brought it up. I think all of this will work out well if we get France on board. I&#x27;m attacking MAO from Channel in preparation for a supported move to Bre (Italy didn&#x27;t mention the MAO moves, and I&#x27;d rather not ask at this point).[SEP]B:OMG I thought adjudication was midnight tonight. We&#x27;ve got so much time. I&#x27;ll be offline for a while (or I should be, cause I need to stop blowing off work). I&#x27;ve ordered:\\nF ENG - MAO\\nF NWG - Cly\\nF Nwy - Swe\\nA Pic - Bre\\n\\nBut we&#x27;ll obviously discuss as adjudication approaches/we learn more.[SEP]B:New Italy message: &quot;Hmmm, Germany is backing off the bait. I think we will have to change our plan.&quot;[SEP]A:Well that&#x27;s not true! But i *did* just disagree to something he wanted me to do in Munich...[SEP]A:Hang on this is good: we&#x27;re gonna see what his real priorities are! He wanted me to cut support from Boh, and I refused.[SEP]B:&quot;Not sure yet, but she is not going to leave Belgium unguarded so that won’t work.&quot;[SEP]A:Okay so he&#x27;s trying to get you to change your moves regarding Pic and the channel...[SEP]B:Yeah. Will be interested to see what he says.[SEP]B:Ok signing off for a few hours now.[SEP]A:Okay so I&#x27;m trying a little experiment: I told Italy that the last message you sent me hinted that if *I* didn&#x27;t work with you, maybe Italy would. I said that knowing this, I *know* there&#x27;s more than what he claims going on with the two of you. There&#x27;s a chance he&#x27;ll tell *me* some &quot;expected&quot; moves of yours, and between what he tells me and what he tells you, we&#x27;ll know exactly what he&#x27;s planning. Or at least get a better sense of it.[SEP]B:Nice. Ok italy’s response is consistent with what you said.[SEP]B:[sigh] please tell me you didn’t tell him everything.[SEP]A:Here&#x27;s what I said, verbatim (it&#x27;s long...hope it doesn&#x27;t break the bot):\\n\\nBut England&#x27;s desperate. Better to talk with someone than just go in blind. And I doubt they&#x27;d turn to Russia or France because neither is really close enough/powerful enough to give real help. And there&#x27;s precedent for you negotiating with someone even as you stab them: France.\\n\\n...and here&#x27;s the real accusation: for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me, you&#x27;ve been sneaky and you&#x27;ve always pitted me and England against each other to your benefit. My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking your advice, it would be so easy to just feed England enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island. \\n\\nI know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over. And I assume others are like me, hence I suspect you now. \\n\\nI&#x27;m offering this confession in hopes that you&#x27;ll do the same. So just come clean and let&#x27;s approach this thing as equals?[SEP]A:I may have gone a little overboard but all my reasoning and everything I say is factual. So he has no reason to suspect you as long as you insist we don&#x27;t talk[SEP]B:Alright that adds up. Something about getting a message from italy about it right after you sending me that made me a little nervous. I’ve explained that we don’t talk[SEP]A:I&#x27;ve confronted him before about deliberately pitting us against each other, so he knows I&#x27;ve always been suspicious of your relationship[SEP]B:Gotcha. Ok he said that you were pressing hard for moves, and that he would respond that we’re friendly but haven’t discussed particular moves[SEP]A:yeah that&#x27;s been his line so far. The lying bastard.[SEP]B:In fairness he doesn’t know my actual moves haha. Still nothing from France? Nothing from my end[SEP]A:Yeah radio silence. France might have a life/better work ethic than any of us. Or maybe just doesn&#x27;t care about this game anymore.[SEP]B:Haha yeah. Well if we hear nothing that may be cause for concern. If i’m not in brest this fall, i’ll have a disband[SEP]B:But speaking of work ethic, i am gone until tomorrow (for real this time). Let’s reconvene in the morning[SEP]A:Ok sounds good[SEP]A:So...Italy really did not take kindly to my confession. I retaliated with “if you don’t trust me, so be it! But i’m not going to just roll over and let you dominate this game”\\n\\nYou can cement italy’s trust of you in the morning by reporting that I’ve approached you with a plan. We can talk about what form that plan should take, or you can just feed Italy anything but the truth. \\n\\nFrance is on board with the stab just fyi. Happy to leave Brest if they’re to be believed, and I think they are.[SEP]B:Ok. Where did France say he would go from Bre?[SEP]A:Gas. That’s still the plan right?[SEP]B:Updates on my end: France asked for my preference on where to go. I told italy this. I asked italy what i should say back. Italy said it shouldn’t matter because he believes france is lying.[SEP]B:Yes, Gas is the plan.[SEP]A:Well if you tell France anything other than gas I look like a liar[SEP]B:I will tell france Gas as well. And it seems like italy is indifferent about what I say, so it shouldn’t raise any eyebrows there.[SEP]B:Now what plan would hypothetical you approach me with??[SEP]A:I *don’t* think you should tell italy France’s real move. Is it too late?[SEP]A:Gimme a bit to fabricate a good hypothetical plan...[SEP]B:Not too late. But then i worry about what to tell France. I suppose if France is a spy we’re doomed anyways. But it would be bad to be found out before the stab.[SEP]B:What if i just don’t respond to france?[SEP]B:Also, i’m going to ask italy for any update on the state of belgium as if I haven’t received a plan from you yet. And then when we’re ready with the plan i’ll say you messaged me.[SEP]A:If france is a spy we’re royally fucked. I’m 95% sure that’s not the case.[SEP]A:Please lie to italy[SEP]B:I will. Should i reply to france though?[SEP]B:Also i think when you have a fake plan, you should type the message up to me like you’re asking for real. That way i have it on hand to send to italy.[SEP]A:Okay. Please reply to france. I’m going to sleep[SEP]B:I told france. If italy asks what i told france, i will say something different. But I don’t think he’ll ask.[SEP]A:Hi England,\\nI know that the last thing I said to you was that a partnership between us wouldn&#x27;t work out, but I&#x27;ve had a genuine change of heart. The reason for that is that I think Italy is far more duplicitous than any of us ever realized; right now they may be promising you that you&#x27;ll take centers of mine, and maybe even that you two will share a victory together. This is my guess because these are the promises they made to me not so long ago. But we both need to face facts: Italy has never hesitated to profit from discord between us, and will always aid the weaker of us at the expense of the stronger. \\nIf you&#x27;re tired of being manipulated in a game Italy feels they own, I have a proposal that might get us both destroyed, but at least we&#x27;ll have stuck up for ourselves and perhaps minorly inconvenienced Italy on their path to victory. This proposal involves France, who is more than willing to use their last few turns to fight back against Italy. Trusting them may be a hard sell, but so is trusting me. If I were really trying to trick you, I wouldn&#x27;t ask something so unreasonable as that you trust us both. But frankly I consider knocking Italy down a peg to be the sole most urgent thing we can do to keep this game viable for any of us. \\nMy proposal is: NWG-Cly, Nth convoy Hol-Yor, Eng-IRI or Wal, Bel s Bre-Eng, Pic-Bre, Par-Pic, Bur-Par, Mun-Bur (I figure I&#x27;m about to lose Mun anyway, and if that happens I&#x27;ll disband my Hel fleet)\\nNext year we&#x27;ll be well-positioned to boot Italy off the island and the iberian. What do you think?[SEP]A:(this part is not for copy-pasting to Italy) I designed this plan to make it look safe for Italy to convoy Gas-Lvp. I know this is what they&#x27;d really like to do. I think we need to do everything we can to try and disrupt this. I know it&#x27;s a riskier move trying to assist Bre into Mao but I think it&#x27;s the right one. I also think that for *extra* insurance NWG should poke NAO, because worst-case scenario Italy doesn&#x27;t try the convoy and moves Nao-Lvp and also moves Mao-Nao to bounce. This guarantees Bre makes it into Mao which strengthens our ability to take the southern holdings, and at worst only sets you back a turn in terms of kicking Italy out of Liverpool. In exchange for doing this riskier move, I agree to convoy to york instead of Edi and give up my build. That part of the fake plan is actually true[SEP]B:Italy is telling me to expect a bounce in Bre. So that’s not consistent with the convoy idea. Maybe he’s lying?[SEP]B:But i haven’t sent the plan yet[SEP]A:So all he says is &quot;expect a bounce&quot;? He could think *I&#x27;m* going to try and take it from you. And this could be further misdirection about the convoy.[SEP]A:Italy can&#x27;t make a bounce if we attack Mao and Gas at the same time, which the real plan has us doing[SEP]B:That’s fair, it could be a bounce we expect from you. Keep in mind that the French fleet disbands in the fall, assuming it leaves Bre. So if it gets into MAO, it will then vacate by spring[SEP]A:Better to vacate Mao than Gas, I think.[SEP]B:Hmm, i mean if we really think it’s a convoy, disrupting the convoy is a great option. You’re saying i support Bre from channel? And let me see how Italy responds to the message[SEP]A:Yes, you&#x27;d support Bre from the channel. and Bel will support the channel.[SEP]B:I also don’t think hitting NAO makes sense. Then we won’t be able to take Lvp next spring[SEP]A:sometimes it&#x27;s like you don&#x27;t even read my messages. I acknowledge that. We&#x27;d have to wait til fall. I&#x27;m making a sacrifice too by convoying to york instead of Edi, and I&#x27;m willing to do that because I think it&#x27;s the right move. Even if there&#x27;s not a convoy, there&#x27;s still a chance you fall into Nao which is advantageous.[SEP]A:The way I see it we don&#x27;t stand a chance unless we can take mao and start beating Italy back into the mediterranean[SEP]B:You didn’t make it clear that Yor was a real move.[SEP]A:I said: &quot;In exchange for doing this riskier move, I agree to convoy to york instead of Edi and give up my build&quot;, how can I get clearer than that?[SEP]B:Whoops haha. I’m still in bed looking on my phone and it’s a lot of text.[SEP]A:I know. Sorry, I get wordy when I&#x27;m on the war path[SEP]B:It’s quite alright. Do you think it’s worth saying anything to germany? If you’re confident that the convoy is the move, what additional edge do we get by sharing fake info?[SEP]A:You mean to Italy? I do think it&#x27;s worth it, because Italy will realize that I&#x27;ll turn to you if I&#x27;m no longer allied with him. By reporting the plan, you cement Italy&#x27;s trust in *you*. If you didn&#x27;t report the plan, Italy&#x27;d suspect you. It also gives Italy a false sense of confidence in what I&#x27;ll do.\\n\\nTentative request: after the stab goes through, do I have your permission to send Italy the quotes from Italy that you&#x27;ve sent me? Italy went to *such lengths* to defend himself and make *me* feel guilty for questioning him, and the sheer hypocrisy of it is so revolting. I want to throw his own betrayal back in his face. I figure he&#x27;s not going to trust you after the stab anyway.[SEP]A:furthermore, Italy may respond to my plan by offering *you* moves to counter it, and you can bet that the moves offered will turn to Italy&#x27;s benefit. We can see if these moves keep you away from Mao and Nao, which will further confirm Italy&#x27;s got his eyes on the convoy[SEP]B:Ok i have to get to campus. Let me send the quote to italy and then i’ll process all this and respond later.[SEP]A:Oh and one more thing: as long as we think the convoy is the real move, we also know that Spain is gonna support Mao, unless Italy is really really cocky. So I&#x27;ll need to support you into Bre with Paris to make sure you get there. This means Burgundy will have to try for Gas unsupported, but again, if we&#x27;re confident the convoy is the play i&#x27;m willing to risk it[SEP]A:I&#x27;ve told France the new move is to Mao and France confirmed. So, the moves the plan needs from you are:\\n\\nEng s Bre-Mao (Bel will support Eng holding)\\nPic-Bre (Paris will support)\\nNwy-Swe\\nNwg-Nao\\n\\nLet me know if you take issue with any of these, or if you ever hear back from Italy. \\nWe have a shot that at least one of these moves will get us somewhere. But I recognize this plan is nowhere near as sure a thing as if you just cooperated with Italy. I want to give you one last chance to back out.[SEP]B:Alright I&#x27;m online now. Give me a moment to process everything.[SEP]B:Ok, all of this looks good to me.[SEP]A:Great! Note that you actually gain a build with this plan. So even if the move to Nao doesn&#x27;t pan out, you can just build an army in Edi and use that to take back lvp[SEP]B:Yeah that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m thinking. If we dislodge the convoy, I get two! You really think Italy won&#x27;t try to snag Por?[SEP]B:Entered moves:\\nF ENG S Bre - MAO\\nF NWG - NAO\\nF Nwy - Swe\\nA Pic - Bre[SEP]A:If they&#x27;re convoying, I would bet not. If they&#x27;re not convoying, then perhaps, but I think an open Mao is still better than an Italian mao. \\n\\nThose moves look good! No word from Italy?[SEP]B:From Italy: &quot;Okay, I think that’s the right move. This is the first turn in a while that is fairly unpredictable from my point of view. It would be really great if you wind up with a build.&quot;[SEP]A:wait, he thinks *what* is the right move?[SEP]B:I said I&#x27;d agree to your proposal but instead move to London and Edi, expecting one of them to bounce.[SEP]A:Brilliant. Let&#x27;s hope he buys it[SEP]B:He definitely trusts me, which is why I think no support from Spa is a possibility. Like if he really trusts me going to london, why wouldn&#x27;t he go for it?[SEP]B:Also, I&#x27;m really hoping you won&#x27;t lose Mun. That would cause some problems.[SEP]B:Can you copy in your set of moves just so I can see the summary? If there&#x27;s any you want to strike from the record out of paranoia, I totally understand.[SEP]A:Full record:\\nF Bel S ENG\\n\\nA Bur - Gas\\n\\nF HEL - Kie\\n\\nA Hol - Yor\\n\\nA Mun - Tyr\\n\\nF NTH C Hol - Yor\\n\\nA Par S Pic - Bre[SEP]B:Cool. I guess the support in Bel is only relevant if MAO surprises with supporting Bre in or something like that[SEP]A:right and I have a weird bias for having my units *do* something other than hold.[SEP]B:I also wanted to talk post-war relations since you brought that up. My ideal would be total silence to Italy from both of us. As tempting as it is to gloat, Italy will use any gloating we do to convince others on the board that we&#x27;re schemers, unreliable, sharing intel at an absurd level etc.[SEP]B:We also should start courting Austria once the moves go through[SEP]B:post-stab relations*[SEP]A:we can try to court Austria, but should do so with extreme trepidation lest anything get shared with Italy[SEP]B:Yeah no sharing of specific moves with Austria, at least not at the beginning. But the alliance is natural since I&#x27;m moving against Russia and we&#x27;re both moving against italy. And we really want it to be a solid 3 on 2.[SEP]B:Nicely done. Thoughts on the silence to italy idea?[SEP]B:Also, austria just took a beating[SEP]A:Accurate. We should sent condolences their way.[SEP]A:And I won&#x27;t speak to Italy[SEP]B:Ok. I won&#x27;t either. He&#x27;s going to be sending some nasty-grams our way I&#x27;m sure.[SEP]A:yeah if you get a juicy one send it to me![SEP]A:ugh I&#x27;m kicking myself I wish i&#x27;d supported Bur-Gas. But hindsight&#x27;s 20/20[SEP]A:So maybe try to cool it with Russia...I&#x27;m thinking we&#x27;re gonna need to go 4 on one if we want a shot at stopping him[SEP]B:Yeah i’ll try to be amicable with russia. I feel like you’ll have more sway since you didn’t just take his territory[SEP]B:Italy just said “well played”[SEP]A:Well he&#x27;s correct about that[SEP]A:And I&#x27;m trying to make overtures to Russia and Austria right now[SEP]B:Haha yeah. I agree that taking down Italy will be tough even if he’s operating mostly alone.[SEP]A:Italy to me: &quot;Well, this game just got less fun&quot;[SEP]B:Haha. Still figuring out what builds will be. Trying to piece together a plan to get you a build from Italy this year, but it looks like that may be a challenge. We&#x27;ll have to make a couple of good guesses.[SEP]A:I think your builds are pretty obvious, right? Fleet in Lvp, army in Edi? \\nIn spring, I&#x27;ll support Edi into Lvp. Meanwhile Lvp moves IRI with support from the channel and Nwg pokes Nao.[SEP]A:With your permission, I&#x27;ll move Nth-Edi and then Edi-Cly in the fall. This way we can shove Italy out of Nao come next spring.[SEP]B:I agree with the builds, and I&#x27;ll review the tactics. We really need an italian disband this year to break the line. With what you&#x27;ve presented we won&#x27;t get Spa or Mar, and by next spring we may have Italy in Lyo and Wes. Not sure if we have a better option on our end, but I&#x27;ll keep thinking.[SEP]A:Right I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much we can do about the south besides get one of us in gascony and put a fleet in Brest and hope for the best.[SEP]A:Nevermind: it&#x27;s better I think to risk Italy in Nwg, since that&#x27;s actually not a huge threat. Nwg should go to Edi and Nth should go to Lon. Dammit, we&#x27;d be in such a better position if I hadn&#x27;t been so paranoid that Russia would move to Munich! Then I&#x27;d have kept my fleet in Hel[SEP]B:Was just running through some tactics. I think I found an issue, but I want to check with you. Suppose Italy ends up with Fleet in Portugal, army in spain, fleet in lyo, fleet in wes, army mar. I think this is a stalemate line. And I don&#x27;t think we can do anything to stop Italy from forming it.[SEP]B:I mean you could mess with North Africa from MAO I guess. But at that point we&#x27;re looking at Tunis as the next build on our front. And that only works if neither NAO nor IRI gets behind the line.[SEP]B:Fingers crossed you can find a flaw in my thinking.[SEP]B:I guess the point is that no amount of cleverness is going to get us those dots until we see disbands (if my thinking is correct, of course)[SEP]A:I think you’re right—if dots is what you’re after, you’re better off stabbing me and Russia than collaborating. But I think you’ll that just getting italy under control takes priority. Russia and Austria might see some dots, but if we do it’ll take a lot longer[SEP]B:I agree i could stab russia with moves on st p or something. I’m not in great tactical position to stab you right now if i wanted to. No question that italy’s the target. But we’ll be dancing with those fleets until they’re off the board from a loss of supply centers. That changes my thinking about our moves a bit.[SEP]A:I know for a fact we can disband at least one of the fleets. I ran quite a few sandboxes in lieu of working today and I&#x27;ll share moves in the morning.[SEP]B:Yeah if you found one, that’s great. Let me know[SEP]B:woah, all armies from italy. I guess I was seeing things through the lens of the worst he could do to us.[SEP]B:Given that the beta test ends in 1909, what are your goals? Just duke it out until then?[SEP]A:was not aware of that! But yeah, I&#x27;ll just go down fighting Italy like hopefully everyone else.[SEP]A:That&#x27;s pretty disappointing this game was just getting good[SEP]B:Yeah admin said this in the general thread a while back. I agree it’s a bit of a shame to see it cut short. But i suppose we’re just the beta testers. I will be glad to be finished though. It was fun, but like WAY too much distraction and stress haha.[SEP]B:Would you play online again after all this?[SEP]B:I’m not sure I would.[SEP]A:I think I would! you&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s way too much distraction but, hey, it keeps me off the streets[SEP]B:Hmm something tells me that you wouldn’t otherwise be out committing violent crimes haha. But then again how well do i really know you from playing a lying game. I will say I’d be down to do an in-person one with CS students at some point.[SEP]B:Btw all other powers (me included) will be setting for a 5-way draw this move.[SEP]A:I had been thinking the same thing! Do you know anyone besides me and admin at UMD who plays?\\n\\nUh huh...sureee they will[SEP]B:AFAIK there&#x27;s no drawback to submitting the draw order (if you&#x27;re ok with the outcome). If there&#x27;s not consensus, play just continues as normal. Well I think admin&#x27; adviser has played. I know [redacted] had expressed interest in playing. Not sure about students though.[SEP]B:And I&#x27;m sure I could recruit a couple of non-UMD friends to play.[SEP]A:I&#x27;m on board with the five-way draw, by the way. \\n\\nAnd I think there&#x27;s a couple board game enthusiasts in my lab who may not have played this particular game before but would probably like it...if you don&#x27;t mind playing with new people[SEP]B:Yeah always down to play with new folks. And I’m down for the draw as well[SEP]B:Reply all to Italy&#x27;s message: First, if you didn&#x27;t get a message from Italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I&#x27;m down for the draw that he has proposed. I&#x27;d also like to add that I&#x27;ll be checking the &quot;Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders&quot; box. If everyone does this maybe we don&#x27;t have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I&#x27;m not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I&#x27;m exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.[SEP]B::’( we were supposed to hug it out!! Any idea who wasn’t on board?[SEP]B:Sorry for not coordinating moves. I really thought the game was gonna be over[SEP]A:So did I! And I have no clue who wasn&#x27;t on board[SEP]B:I guess we try the draw again?? I suppose it’s possible a game could be set up to not support the regular draw settings. I dunno.[SEP]B:Not sure your interest level in the game at this point, but we should at least make sure italy doesn’t win right?[SEP]A:can italy take five centers this turn??[SEP]B:Nah, but maybe admin will be like “oh btw let’s go until 1914 now!”.[SEP]B:Any guesses on who is holding out on the draw?[SEP]A:who keeps screwing with the draw though! Do you think Italy suggested it just to mess with all of us?[SEP]A:oh haha we just asked the same thing[SEP]B:That’s my best guess. He’s kind of the only one with the incentive to keep it going. And with his winning track record, probably the only one who cares enough to be this sneaky[SEP]A:well I&#x27;m honestly not invested enough to care if that happens anyway[SEP]B:I’m not very invested either, but i’d rather not see italy win, especially if this is how he did it[SEP]A:well let me know if there&#x27;s anything you want me to do, then[SEP]B:Ok, will do. We’ve got a day before the next move[SEP]B:I think[SEP]B:Ok would you be up for: Paris support Brest Hold, and then get one of your fleets into the channel? And then don&#x27;t go to Nth as I&#x27;ll be moving Nth to NWG and Denmark to Nth to make sure he can&#x27;t break through in the north? Yor holds?[SEP]B:Pic support Brest hold as well would guarantee that he can&#x27;t take it from the channel.[SEP]A:Pic needs to support paris but other than that Ok[SEP]B:Pic can&#x27;t, since it&#x27;s a fleet.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m supporting paris from brest[SEP]A:oh right---ok thanks[SEP]B:And actually can Yor support Wales?[SEP]A:Yep![SEP]B:Great! Glad we&#x27;re doing this since I think otherwise italy has a serious shot at 18 by the end of 1910.[SEP]B:Wait I&#x27;m actually doing our moves wrong if we want to hold paris. I need to attack Gas from Bre. Otherwise, Eng cuts Bre support, Gas supports Bur to Par. So I&#x27;m going to do that instead.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m doing my moves wrong*[SEP]B:Par to Gas is a good move paired with that. Cuts support for either the Bre or Par attack from Italy, and the armies will bounce right back to where they came from. Up to you though.[SEP]B:Looks like it all worked. A little surprised about the supported move into brest. Do you want it?[SEP]B:Looking at the board a bit more, we&#x27;ll have to be clever to keep Italy from any more centers on our side of the board. I think the following will do it: Bre and Par to Gas, Ruh to Bur, channel to MAO, NTH to NWG. We can ask russia to attack Tyr to cut support (Tri is going to fall anyways). I can hold the island as long as Yor doesn&#x27;t attack me.[SEP]A:The Brest support was just in case Italy moves Gas into Brest supported by Eng. I should have realized that with Lon moving to Eng that move would not have gone through anyway, but I&#x27;m not paying as much attention to this game anymore.[SEP]A:And okay your plan seems to make sense but I&#x27;ll check...[SEP]B:Cool, sounds good.[SEP]A:okay submitted those moves[SEP]B:I&#x27;m doing same moves as last time, except for supporting Wales to IRI[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;9&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;[CLS]B:Hey there. What are your thoughts on an anti-English opening, like a sea lion, as Germany? If you enjoy something like that then we might make good allies.[SEP]A:Bonjour--not sure what a &#x27;sea lion&#x27; is![SEP]B:It&#x27;s when a lion is stranded at sea, like in the life of pi.[SEP]A:That was a tiger. Let me know what you&#x27;d like me to do--I imagine it involves letting you take Belgium?[SEP]B:Good point. Sea tiger sounds more menacing anyway. \\n\\nIt all depends on how you like to play Germany and your relationship with Russia. I can be flexible, and if it makes sense for me to have Belgium to set up for a future play then that is good with me.[SEP]A:Admittedly, I&#x27;ve never played this game before! Don&#x27;t go spreading that around[SEP]B:You sound experienced for someone who is playing the game for the first time- I&#x27;m sure few people would be able to tell.[SEP]A:I appreciate that, mon ami![SEP]B:Nice moves. What are your thoughts on the map?[SEP]A:Well I&#x27;m wondering what you&#x27;re up to in Burgundy, for starters[SEP]B:Haha. I was looking to secure a position on Belgium and it seemed like the best way to do it. Depending on your plans, I could take Belgium with Burgundy, which could set us up nicely to work together[SEP]B:Sorry for the late reply, the bot was down.[SEP]A:I think taking Belgium with Burgundy would be wise[SEP]B:That sounds ominous. What are your thoughts on England[SEP]B:Any plans for Holland? Would you want to support Burgundy to Belgium? It&#x27;s hard to read you and I&#x27;m not sure what you are planning[SEP]B:So much for being wise 😂 😂[SEP]B:Can we have a conversation at some point? I&#x27;d love to figure things out with you[SEP]A:Sorry--I was out last night and couldn&#x27;t answer your questions!\\n\\nI was cagey because I still have no sense of who to trust and who not to. But I&#x27;d like to trust you if you think you can trust me too. I understand if not because of my unannounced visit to Burgundy...I was just attempting to have some insurance in case there was funny business[SEP]B:Thanks for getting back to me- and no worries. Hopefully when the deadline is moved away from midnight it will be a bit easier lol. To be totally fair to you, you never actually said you wouldn&#x27;t move to Burgundy. For me it isn&#x27;t a trust issue but a communication issue, which I think can be easily fixed.[SEP]B:Have you been talking to England at all?[SEP]A:I did: England tried to make a deal with me to take Belgium (I was supposed to support E&#x27;s move from the north sea while attacking Burgundy), but we both reneged.[SEP]B:I see. I ask since I have a feeling England might be playing us against eachother. He also asked for support to Belgium Lol. For now I&#x27;m building armies, but maybe we can get to a point where we can re-establish a border between us.[SEP]B:I&#x27;d rather settle the matter of Burgundy diplomatically rather than with force. Any chance you will consider withdrawing from Burgundy?[SEP]B:The one thing I think neither of us can afford is a war of armies. We would be giving away the entire ocean to England&#x27;s units, and there&#x27;s an Italian/Austrian coalition growing that will be a concern in the long run[SEP]A:I gotta say France, right now it seems like the best move for me is to work against you so I’m not so hemmed in.[SEP]A:That said, I’m no strategist. What are your thoughts?[SEP]B:Let&#x27;s say you built armies in Munich and Kiel and started marching in my direction. These armies can&#x27;t go on water, they can&#x27;t move past Gascony/Paris/Marseilles as my units will soon be there, and so the only places to go for your armies are Ruhr... and that&#x27;s about it. Isn&#x27;t this a huge traffic jam? Wouldn&#x27;t you be hemming yourself in even more by building armies? That&#x27;s what I mean by it will be devastating to both of us to get into an army war and let England control the entire ocean. We&#x27;re bidding over such a small area of land.[SEP]B:One option for we could consider is that I could dislodge your army and you could choose to remove it from the board. That way, you could build it in a place where you might need it more if you are feeling hemmed-in.[SEP]A:No thanks, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s in my best interest right now[SEP]B:Ok. Sounds like you&#x27;ve already made up your mind about things. Let me know when that changes.[SEP]B:Not sure what your plan is. I&#x27;m covering Marseilles, Paris, and Belgium so you have no chance to take a supply center this turn.[SEP]B:The bot was down but I meant to contact you earlier[SEP]B:You put up quite a strong defense against me, which I&#x27;m sure was your goal[SEP]B:I was suprised you retreated to Munich over Marseilles that one turn but it worked out for you[SEP]B:I want to help you protect your supply centers if that is alright with you.[SEP]A:Why do you want to help me?[SEP]B:I&#x27;m worried about England, and you are frankly one of the only things stopping him from attacking me. I&#x27;m just looking at it rationally: what is England going to do with all those fleets? I wish we were able to work something out so that both of us would have some fleets at least. But rihgt now England has 4 fleets and you have 1 and I have 2. And he&#x27;s going to blow up your fleet in Holland this turn, it&#x27;s basically a guarantee.[SEP]B:Let&#x27;s say he gets 2 builds and builds 2 fleets. Am I going to be able to stop him, even if Russia and I team up? He&#x27;ll dominate the entire ocean.[SEP]B:At that point, it really won&#x27;t matter how many supply centers I take from you because I won&#x27;t be able to prevent an English fleet invasion.[SEP]B:I mean, what are your thoughts on the whole situation?[SEP]B:We should talk more. I&#x27;m not lying about wanting to help you, but it&#x27;s hard because you aren&#x27;t talking to me, and everything you have done so far this game seems to have been against me.[SEP]A:well fat lot of good it&#x27;s done me. I think you&#x27;re right about the danger of letting England control the sea. But I&#x27;m not sure what I in my current state can do about it[SEP]B:Can Helgoland Blight move to the North Sea? This would cut support, allowing me to take the English Channel.[SEP]A:It could, but that would leave holland undefended[SEP]B:Hmm. That&#x27;s a good point. And Kiel is probably busy defending Berlin/Munich since Russia is in the Baltic and Silesia and could double team you with Italy. It&#x27;s funny, there are so many units at your doorstep, but you might end up keeping all your dots this turn.[SEP]B:I assumed you were working with England somewhat after last turn, since it seemed like he could have guaranteed Holland and chose not to.[SEP]B:If supporting Munich is what is preventing Kiel from blocking Holland, I can support Munich[SEP]A:That wouldn&#x27;t be enough: I need to defend munich *and* berlin somehow and there&#x27;s no way to do both without Kiel[SEP]B:Yeah, you are right, I can&#x27;t think of a way to do it either. No worries, we can try something next turn depending on how the moves turn out.[SEP]B:Well. You did well for yourself that turn 🙂. Really impressive diplomacy[SEP]B:I want to apologize for entering Ruhr- I wasn&#x27;t sure what else to do honestly. I should have given you a heads up and that&#x27;s my fault. I&#x27;m sorry.[SEP]B:And it&#x27;s ended up being doubly bad as now I&#x27;m a turn behind in terms of defending myself with Italy coming after Iberia and all. sigh.[SEP]B:I think we are at the point where we should talk about working together. If you want a decent result, I think your best bet is to work with me.[SEP]B:I honestly do, since I think your growth potential is going to be limited by the fact that we both have way too many armies and not enough fleets. So this means that your growth is limited to Paris/Belgium, and that&#x27;s if you make it past 4 armies.[SEP]B:What I&#x27;m trying to say is that the big winners are Italy and England.[SEP]B:We&#x27;re the big losers. There&#x27;s almost nothing we can do. Unless Russia, you, and I plug the holes in our defenses by working together.[SEP]A:Have you talked to russia at all about this?[SEP]A:What would you want me to do this year?[SEP]A:Hi France--wanted to confirm our plan for this season and next: I disrupt Nth support from Holland, and in exchange you&#x27;ll kindly scooch out of Belgium in the fall (into Ruhr, I imagine)? At which point I&#x27;ll build a fleet in Holland?[SEP]A:Actually, I&#x27;d have to build the fleet in Kiel, I think[SEP]B:1. I have. We&#x27;re both trying our best to defend ourselves from England- we&#x27;re too far from eachother for tactical manuevering but so far we&#x27;ve managed to avoid any losses[SEP]B:2. Despite Italian incoming invasion, I am still completely focused on taking the Channel, as that will give me much needed breathing room. If Holland can move to the North Sea, it will cut support and I will take EC[SEP]B:3. I am withdrawing from Ruhr. I know this leaves me open to you taking it back and working with England to capture Belgium in the fall. I can&#x27;t think of another way to get you a center, so my promise is that if the board doesn&#x27;t shake up somehow I&#x27;ll give you Belgium either this turn or next turn on the condition that you build a fleet[SEP]B:That&#x27;s correct, you can build a fleet from Kiel or from Berlin but not from Holland. You need to make sure one of those is vacated during the Winter phase. Vacating Kiel can be dangerous as England is in Denmark and could in theory take Kiel from you.[SEP]B:I will vacate Belgium in the fall for you. Not yet sure what the best way to do it would be to make sure we don&#x27;t lose it or Holland to an English fleet.[SEP]A:I know England has their eye on sweden so we&#x27;ll see how that baltic region shapes up next turn and that will determine where I build my fleet.[SEP]A:it&#x27;s risky, but I think I&#x27;ll be safe leaving Berlin vulnerable to Russia in the fall...let me know if you hear/think otherwise when that time comes[SEP]B:Will do. I definitely agree, I spoke with Russia briefly and I believe he intends to leave you alone from now on.[SEP]A:Good guy russia. sorry if you&#x27;ve been watching me type, I&#x27;ve been starting to ask you questions and then confirming their answers for myself in a sandbox! 😂[SEP]B:No worries. Feel free to ask anyhing- though the sandbox is really helpful too 🙂[SEP]A:Okay--real question: assuming you take the channel with Brest an then England retreats to London, aren&#x27;t you going to just lose the channel anyway?[SEP]A:oh wait nevermind I can prevent that if I keep my fleet in Holland and prevent Nth support twice. But this means I need to move Kiel into Ruhr during the spring to take my sweet, promised belgium in the fall. Picardy will have to support my movement of Ruhr into Belgium and you&#x27;ll have to disband the unit. That&#x27;s all fine, right?[SEP]A:BUUUT England could foresee this and support with the london fleet and move with Nth...in which case, at least they lose Nth, I guess.[SEP]B:Great point. I will have to disband a unit anyway in the fall after losing Belgium, so it won&#x27;t matter if I need to pull it.[SEP]B:Losing the channel might be rough, that&#x27;s true. Hmm, I actually hadn&#x27;t thought too much about it. I think if he does that at the very least I can retreat into Wales and threaten Liverpool (assuming that Wales goes to cover London)[SEP]B:Give me a reason to defend myself against Italy. As it stands, I&#x27;m just going to let him solo.[SEP]B:What do you think Italy is going to do once he kills me?[SEP]B:Don&#x27;t you agree that Austria will need somewhere to go with all his armies?[SEP]B:I swear. I&#x27;m trying my hardest to work with you.[SEP]B:Look. I will defend myself against Italy. But I need to know that I will be in the draw. If you and England are just going to fuck me from behind, then there is no incentive for me to defend myself against Italy.[SEP]A:Hey, I really am sorry about the stab. You probably won&#x27;t believe me but let me explain myself:\\n\\nI knew I was making a deal with the devil when I agreed to help England, but England, Italy, Austria, and Russia were/are basically all allied and I figured it was either you or me they turned on. The turning point was when I realized that after I stab England you might not even hold the channel anyway. I couldn&#x27;t afford to risk fury from all sides. \\n\\nBut now I&#x27;m in a potentially very good position for you: England and Italy *trust* me. I am in the process of finding out--under no suspicion, mind you, because of our alliance and shared plans--their moves for this season. Once I learn those, I can relay them to you.[SEP]A:Doing so would clearly be in my interest. The longer you&#x27;re in the running, the longer I escape getting devoured myself on three or more fronts.[SEP]A:If you manage to look just lucky or smart by making the right moves to counter their attacks this season, I can continue to double-agent and help keep you defended and possibly even expanded into England.\\n\\nI just spoke with England and I can confirm that you will be able to take the channel if you want to--they&#x27;re supporting me into Belgium from Nth. \\n\\nI can&#x27;t be as direct asking this of Italy, but I&#x27;m trying to figure out whether they&#x27;re going to use the lion&#x27;s share of their force against Marseilles or Spain. If I can figure this out you may have a better chance of holding.\\n\\nI&#x27;m going to send the info your way whether you believe me or not.[SEP]B:Ok. I get that- I&#x27;m sorry for not explaining it well. Losing the channel doesn&#x27;t matter to me. It gives me excellent retreat options and allows me to defend myself against Italy without worrying about what England is up to.[SEP]B:There&#x27;s no way Russia is allied with Italy and Austria. Just look at how aggressive Austria is in attacking Russia...[SEP]B:Nothing can be done at this point though. Thanks for the offer of intel- this is basically all I wanted to hear. As long as I have a chance to be in the draw I won&#x27;t give up and maybe something will shake up and give me a chance to recover[SEP]B:You should work on England- he&#x27;s not even communicating with me. I must have done something to piss him off. But if he keeps this up it&#x27;s going to end badly for him too.[SEP]B:For the future, let me know in advance when you are planning something like this. If I knew you were not cutting the North Sea I would have played this way differently by bouncing Italy out of the West Med, and we&#x27;d be in a much stronger position.[SEP]A:It’s not that Russia is allied with austria, but Russia is cooperating strongly with England to the point that they don’t even talk to me.\\nFor what it’s worth, I can confirm that Italy’s going to shoot for Spain.[SEP]A:(They meaning Russia. I get kind of annoyed with everyone using “he” to refer to these players)[SEP]B:I am sure Russia is just uncommunicative. Since the start of the game he&#x27;s only sparingly talked with me[SEP]B:*They&#x27;ve, sorry[SEP]B:Just given that they seem to be fighting in Scandinavia. But you probably have more information than I do.[SEP]B:By the way, what&#x27;s the plan that Italy and England proposed to you in terms of your units? Are you attacking Burgundy with ruhr and Munich?[SEP]A:Oh that&#x27;s not a fight that&#x27;s planned high-fives. At least according to England.\\nNope--attacking Belgium with Ruhr and Amsterdam. We&#x27;re in the process of discussing whether Munich should bother poking Belgium.[SEP]A:Burgundy*[SEP]A:I take back what I said about Italy shooting for spain. I thought it was decided but Italy wants to keep that decision to themself[SEP]B:Thanks. I&#x27;m probably going to flip a coin for Spain/Marseilles. Has England expressed any concern over the Italian/Austrian growth? I worry that England has been charmed by Italy. Or maybe they just dislike me that much.[SEP]B:YES! That worked very well. You&#x27;re getting a build! Please please please build a fleet 🙂🙂🙂[SEP]A:I intend to build a fleet. Are you gonna disband Pic?[SEP]A:woops miscounted[SEP]A:disband nothing[SEP]B:Yep, it got popped since Belgium had nowhere to retreat to.[SEP]B:Neat, bot is back up now. Hmm, maybe it was just the one message that was bugged somehow. Whoops. I&#x27;ll copy paste it back[SEP]B:What do you want to do here? I am really hoping that we can coordinate something together. I think AI is starting to have some pressure put on their relationship with a greedy Italy. I understand England is in a tough position where their best move is probably to stay put and do nothing, which is always a tough sell (I just wish they would actually read my messages instead of sabotaging my ability to help them fight Italy)[SEP]B:I checked out Italy&#x27;s history. He&#x27;s [redacted] from playdiplomacy.com. he&#x27;s ranked the number one player on the entire site, and that&#x27;s probably the most popular Diplomacy site of them all[SEP]B:If we don&#x27;t stop this here he&#x27;s going to solo. No question.[SEP]B:Sorry for the gendered pronouns- I keep forgetting to neutralize them sometimes since I&#x27;ve played with some of these players before in FTF[SEP]B:Yeah lol. I&#x27;m totally fine with England in my territory honestly[SEP]B:They have been fun to work with while it lasted, they seem transparent and honest. I&#x27;d trust[SEP]B:Anonymity is tough to keep up with the discord names and the fact that the usernames are in the Backstabbr too. That being said, I didn&#x27;t mean to upset you if you&#x27;re uncomfortable discussing that- if it makes it better I have ignored it completely until I recently found out about the published names. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a discussion point, it&#x27;s pretty clear by now that Italy knows what they are doing.[SEP]B:Haha. Fair enough, that is true, it is unfair. I&#x27;m totally guilty of accidentally assuming masculine pronouns in online games, and I&#x27;m working on changing that since it is a big issue. It&#x27;s good to do as a default and I appreciate that you brought it up. I think Austria, Italy, Turkey, Russia, and I know eachother, albeit with varying degrees of familiarity.[SEP]B:I know you were joking a bit when you said anonymity did you no good in this game, but seriously, I think you are playing great. I would have never guessed you are a first time player. Are you really sweat_smile? You are playing extremely well[SEP]B:Any news from England? I hope that they will consider working to stop Italy[SEP]A:I messaged them but haven&#x27;t heard yet[SEP]A:Ok here&#x27;s what I know:\\nEngland is going to keep away from Russia&#x27;s northern holdings for a while in order to avoid feeding Austria. However, The Norway fleet is headed for MAO for the start of next year, and England is very much still intent on seeing you consumed. Italy has told me definitively which of your centers is getting full force this turn (under some pretense about needing to coordinate so me and England could be more effective) and it&#x27;s Spain. I&#x27;m going to hold and support Belgium and move Kie-Ruh with support.[SEP]A:I&#x27;m also going to poke Bur[SEP]B:Thanks so much for the info. Will do. Any chance you go to Tyrolia instead of poking Burgundy? It won&#x27;t matter for me that much but for you it could save a lot of headache and potentially exacerbate AI tensions[SEP]B:Alternatively a written commitment from Italy not to go to Tyrolia would be smart[SEP]A:I&#x27;m not ready for Italy not to trust me anymore. I&#x27;ll try to see about that commitment though...[SEP]B:That turn went well for you. With Russia out of Silesia you certainly have more breathing room. Only downside may be Italy in Tyrolia, but hopefully they committed to not moving there or at least are aware that you aren&#x27;t ok with it hanging out there. Thanks to you, Italy has ground to a halt in southern France. I&#x27;m hoping we can repeat it again this turn.\\n\\nYou should ask England for Denmark. If they say no, no big deal. But it should be yours- they are the ones that took it from you. And it&#x27;s significantly hampering your manueveravility and ability to build units where you want to as it borders the extremely important Kiel.[SEP]A:Italy offered not to move into Tyr, but gave a good justification for why they weren&#x27;t interested in attacking Munich, so I let them.\\n\\nI just asked England about Denmark. \\n\\nAs for Italy, I&#x27;ll have to come up with the right pretense to extract their plans again this turn...maybe you could help me with that? England and me are pretty much in the routine of sharing moves though so you&#x27;re at least guaranteed those.[SEP]B:Sweet. Assuming England/Italy want you to move into Burgundy, you could pretend to be worried that I might bounce you out of Burgundy and ask if Italy has some moves that can help occupy my units in Marseilles and Gascony.[SEP]B:Any updates by any chance?[SEP]A:I’m waiting to hear from Italy[SEP]B:Any info you think might help me in defending against England and Italy? My plan is literally giving you all my centers while Italy and England get nothing, since I can&#x27;t defend all three and you are the only one who has been helping me.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m assuming England is going all in and moving to NAO, maybe even to Irish and Channel?[SEP]A:Right, England is moving to NAO but otherwise holding everything this turn. No deal on Denmark, unfortunately. Next year will be a play for MAO.\\n\\nAnd Italy is deadset on randomizing their move, so I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t have intel for you this time--I did try, though: England (at my suggestion) offered to assist Italy into MAO, but Italy refused.[SEP]B:Thanks[SEP]A:And as for me, I&#x27;ll be taking Bur.[SEP]B:Darn, that went poorly.[SEP]A:It was a coin toss; nothing you could have done. I didn&#x27;t foresee (or know about) the move to Naf but in hindsight it makes perfect sense.[SEP]A:It&#x27;s kind of a privilege getting to watch Italy play, esp. knowing who he is[SEP]B:Yeah for sure. Hey but thanks for all your help. I&#x27;d have died a lot sooner if not for you.[SEP]A:It&#x27;s been a pleasure! Thanks for playing with a newb 😃[SEP]B:If you&#x27;re having fun, I&#x27;d encourage you to check out face to face games in your local area. Online is great, but FTF is really something else 🙂.[SEP]B:Anyway, I&#x27;d like to be a part of the discussion for how to distribute my dots. I&#x27;d ideally like this to go in a way where it sets up you and Italy nicely to take out England and Austria[SEP]A:I see this game lasting longer if Italy receives as few dots as possible...what&#x27;s your reasoning for favoring I over E?[SEP]B:I am pretty sure England will stab you once they are done killing me. Italy has Austria to deal with. But England has nowhere to go. MAO is a huge stalemate line. Italy can litterally have a unit in Spain, Portugal, and MAO, not to mention Wmed and NaF, and there is nothing England or you can do to get past that line.[SEP]B:If you and England were going to be a long term alliance, England needed to be in the MAO helping me keep the lines years ago. At this point even if I give England all my dots, Italy has enough units to the point where it&#x27;s locked up. So that&#x27;s the logical reason, but there&#x27;s also the fact that England hasn&#x27;t replied to my messages in over ten seasons and I have evidence of then working closely with Italy. I think that&#x27;s a pretty big indication that they will hand Italy dots and have no intention or interest in working with me.[SEP]B:In the end I probably am eliminated either way, so if you want to give England a shot then I can swing that way. But I&#x27;d highly recommend against it even though I&#x27;m sure you trust England very much.[SEP]A:Okay, I see your point about MAO and England having nowhere to go.[SEP]A:Thanks for disbanding Pic--that helps me out a lot!\\nAre you speaking with Italy at all about your plans?[SEP]B:Nope, Italy hasn&#x27;t replied.[SEP]A:Italy just told me as much too. Says they don&#x27;t trust you...but your track record with me has been pretty good so I want to continue to work with you. \\n...and actually, I&#x27;ve been seriously mulling over a backstab of England this turn and I was wondering if you would want to help. Specifically, if you think that MAO is destined for italy anyway, I&#x27;ll support you into the channel. Meanwhile, I&#x27;ll move a fleet into Hel and an army to Kiel to prepare to swipe denmark. \\nI haven&#x27;t entirely thought this through, but what do you think?[SEP]B:That sounds great! If we knew English orders, we could potentially come up with an even deadlier plan. I&#x27;ll have to think more about it, but if England convoys into Brest again, I could move Brest to Picardy to let it in, and bounce NAO. With Italy dislodging MAO, I could then retreat to the Irish Sea and take Liverpool while Paris, Picardy, and Gascony could reclaim Brest. This would have the advantage of not making moves that would give away the stab in the spring.[SEP]A:So I&#x27;m Paris in that scenario right? \\nAnd I&#x27;m talking with England about their orders right now. They want to take IRI this turn, actually, and want me to support Nth into the channel. If I agree, they actually prefer to move Nwg into Nth than try for Nao. *That&#x27;s* how unwilling they are to just give me denmark back![SEP]B:Oh wow, I see. Hmm, well looking at the map I think this would still work. We&#x27;d need to find a way to make sure England can&#x27;t take Holland in the fall (or we could just risk it). I think it makes sense to move Brest to the English Channel instead of MAO so that I have the option to retreat somewhere valuable (like into NAO).[SEP]B:These moves guarantee Denmark but England could retreat to Sweden, which is something to be aware about.[SEP]A:I agree about Brest-Eng. But me and England are still hammering stuff out so it&#x27;s not final yet...[SEP]A:Breaking news: England has decided (or at least has told me) that they don&#x27;t want to try for IRI anymore. Instead, they&#x27;re planning to convoy into Brest or Pic (I&#x27;m waiting on their reply to confirm which), poke Nao from Nwg, and otherwise hold/support as appropriate[SEP]A:ugh. sorry but the plan changed again: England is going to poke Nao, but otherwise just hold everything. No convoy. \\n\\nI can still move Brest into the Channel if you want, and if you *really* want to irk England you can move to IRI. If I also set myself up for Denmark like I said, I&#x27;d have to move Ruhr into Holland to defend there, leaving my southeast pretty exposed, but I think that&#x27;s a reasonable risk right now. What do you think?[SEP]A:There&#x27;s also a nonzero chance that England is lying to me...they seemed pretty suspicious of me this time around compared to previous conversations. However, I&#x27;m pretty certain they&#x27;re not lying about not trying to convoy; they&#x27;re really insecure about you getting close to the island and not having anyone there to defend it.[SEP]A:You&#x27;re retreating to Portugal, right? If you can poke Mao from Brest, you may be able to defend spain. And if Italy does something crafty so that you end up falling into Mao, I can fall into/bump England from Brest?[SEP]A:huh. So you *really* don&#x27;t like England, I guess?[SEP]B:Darn, I missed this message actually, I should have told you what I was planning. I think Italy had Spain guaranteed with MAO-Portugal and Marseilles-Spain with 2 supports. Italy actually then offered me on retreating to the Irish Sea, and in exchange we would collaborate on dislodging the English Channel. I figured it would benefit you as well since this would prevent England from getting off of the island (if they were to convoy to Belgium or something).[SEP]A:Oh good--glad to hear Italy&#x27;s talking with you! \\n...but England could retreat to Pic?[SEP]B:We&#x27;re not talking much, it was kind of a spontaneous thing. You are right to be concerned about the retreat to Picardy. I&#x27;ll have to see if that can be avoided somehow. If not, it&#x27;s not the end of the world. If absolutely needed I can just not support the supposed Italian move to the Channel, which may or may not happen anyway.[SEP]B:Anyway, you also have a guess- kind of. Not sure about what you&#x27;ve told England about the last moves, but perhaps they will use the North Sea to support Denmark to hold, in which case the support can be cut from Belgium.[SEP]A:That was one of a few scenarios I was thinking about. But I gotta say, I don&#x27;t like the idea of Italy in the channel. I thought *you* were going to be there. Did Italy give a reason why they want it?[SEP]A:Is it okay if I ask Italy about it?[SEP]B:That&#x27;s fair. It might be best to not ask Italy directly, but that is up to you (just because it seemed that if Italy is actually serious about this proposal, they would want the element of surprise). Italy wants to do this probably because they want to take the gamble and hope that it will shake up the West a little bit. They didn&#x27;t actually say that, but it is what I infer.[SEP]A:I did end up asking...couldn&#x27;t handle the suspense! And ever since I heard about it I&#x27;ve been wondering if there&#x27;s some plotting I could do to turn this to my and your advantage at the expense of both Italy and England. Italy said they wouldn&#x27;t do it if I didn&#x27;t want them to...I&#x27;m thinking I could demand that they use WES to bounce with England in MAO, which then means that the battle for Spain becomes 2 v 2 and you keep it.[SEP]B:That&#x27;s really clever! We&#x27;d have to hope that Italy wouldn&#x27;t move MAO to Portugal, but otherwise that works well.[SEP]A:Meanwhile, I could support you into the channel from IRI?[SEP]B:Sure[SEP]B:Does that mean you are not going after Denmark?[SEP]A:Well I&#x27;m trying to gauge E&#x27;s trust of me right now, so I&#x27;ll see and get back to you[SEP]B:Any news?[SEP]A:Are you going to assist Italy into the channel?[SEP]A:England doesn’t trust me, unfortunately, so I don’t think I can swing anything clever[SEP]B:I probably will. Do you think Italy actually intends to follow through?[SEP]A:I think so from talking to them, but I&#x27;ve been wrong before. I&#x27;ve come around to the idea, actually (a weekend away from this game has cleared my head!). So, should I support Brest holding from Paris? Btw, are you going to let me keep Paris?[SEP]B:Yep you can stay in Paris. If you can support Brest hold that would be amazing![SEP]B:I&#x27;ll submit the orders to support Italy into the channel then and just see what happens[SEP]A:I&#x27;m sorry, France, I made an 11th-hour deal (literally in the past two minutes) with England and Italy. I really really did not mean to deceive you[SEP]B:No worries, it&#x27;s the game, and I think you made the right choice. As long as you aren&#x27;t afraid to lie to England/Italy :). I&#x27;m rooting for you to do well this game. Congrats on 2 builds![SEP]A:Thanks. I&#x27;ve learned a lot from you this game, so thanks for talking with me 😃[SEP]B:Happy to. I still have one dot left, and it looks like fleet Picardy will be the most useful to you, but I can keep Gascony or something else as well. Now that all the French centers are gone, you will have to decide between Italy and England.[SEP]A:I feel like Italy&#x27;s 10 well-defended units made that decision for me. But even if I change my mind on that, I think Pic would be the most helpful to keep[SEP]A:Me and Italy are strategizing now about ousting England from Brest/the channel. Are you more willing to support one of those two moves?[SEP]A:Actually, we could support you into Brest, then have you support one of us into the channel in Fall?[SEP]B:Sure[SEP]B:Moving to Brest right now[SEP]A:Excellent! Do you and Italy have any kind of agreement about Portugal?[SEP]B:Well Italy said that they would consider letting me keep it as long as I am useful :)[SEP]A:Well this move definitely is. So I hope they keep their word[SEP]B:Nice turn for you! I wonder what England will do at this point. Based on their retreat, it looks like they could be defending London and Edinburgh so a convoy to Yorkshire or possibly even a move to Norway seem like the strongest plays[SEP]B:Can&#x27;t believe Italy is going to get into Liverpool.[SEP]B:Anyway, I&#x27;m holding in Brest for now, but let me know if I can do something else with that unit.[SEP]A:yeah that&#x27;s an unpleasant surprise. Has Italy promised you anything? Based on some things I&#x27;ve pieced together, I&#x27;m starting to realize the full extent of their manipulation of this entire game. It&#x27;s honestly kind of unsettling.\\n\\n...I hope this can stay between us, France, but I&#x27;ve got two sandboxes up right now: one where I put aside my beef with England just to try and get Italy under control, and one where I keep dancing with the devil, which I will follow through with only on the condition they agree *not* to take one of Liverpool or Portugal this year. Neither of these plans has you staying in Brest. If you&#x27;re willing to do either of those things (help with an Italy stab or more English destruction) at the expense of Brest, let me know and let me know which you&#x27;d prefer. If not, well, that may tip the scales to me staying with Italy, because I don&#x27;t think we can swing the stab without your help.[SEP]B:Happy to order whatever you want.[SEP]B:I know there&#x27;s no chance for me to live in this game unless someone else wants it. I think I may have some insight that&#x27;s worth keeping me around. But if it makes more sense for me to go out now, I&#x27;ll do it.[SEP]A:You&#x27;re good people, France! And I have Italy&#x27;s word that they&#x27;re not taking Portugal anytime soon. Though Italy&#x27;s word is literally not worth the electric current encoding it. \\n\\nWhat insight are you referring to, may I ask?[SEP]B:Thanks. I definitely don&#x27;t want to see Italy run away with this game. Hmm, well I guess I may be able to offer insight in terms of helping with orders. I&#x27;m sure an EGR alliance can stop the AI. Mathematically we will hold 17 centers at the end of this year, which is usually the magic number to prevent a solo since you need 18 to win. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t leave any leeway to lose ground anywhere and more eyes on the map can be useful.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m assuming Austria can&#x27;t be turned against Italy. I&#x27;ve tried for the past couple years, even organizing a 3 way convo between Russia, Austria, and I. I don&#x27;t think Austria is willing to stab Italy.[SEP]B:I know I said earlier that it would make sense for you to work with Italy, though I&#x27;ve admittedly changed my mind. Especially after the last orders, Italy is nigh unstoppable if you and England fight since Italy will soon reach a critical number of units where they can defeat any opponent. Also, there are no easy stalemate lines in the West to stop them anymore really.[SEP]B:It&#x27;s ultimately up to you though. I could see a scenario where you work with Italy to take out England, and a well timed Austria stab of Italy leaves you to establish a strong defense and get a good draw result[SEP]A:So, that&#x27;s exactly what Italy has promised me. However, I know for a fact that he&#x27;s (Italy has lost the courtesy of nonspecific &#x27;they&#x27; in my book) been working with England and feeding England my proposed moves for this turn. (Keep that quiet, please!) \\nWithout revealing that England has been communicating with me, I think I *might* be about to get Italy to confess what he&#x27;s been doing. He&#x27;s asked for a half hour to pick his kids up from school (despite my urging that he abandon them and respond to me now), and then he&#x27;s going to respond. If he confesses, I&#x27;m going to side with Italy. In which case I&#x27;d like you to move into the channel (where both Bel and Mao [maybe] will support your move). \\nIf he doesn&#x27;t, Paris will support you into Gascony. Meanwhile Eng moves IRI and Bel moves Eng. In the north, I convoy to Edi (England&#x27;s willing to allow me the build this winter) while Eng moves Nwg.[SEP]B:Sounds good.[SEP]B:I&#x27;m only talking to you at this point. No info will be leaked.[SEP]B:Convoying to Edi sounds like a good idea. I don&#x27;t have context on Italy&#x27;s plan at all, but if I were him I&#x27;d probably convoy Gascony into Liverpool[SEP]A:Italy is vile and even if we all die doing it I want to see him minorly inconvenienced. I’d like to move forward with the anti-italian plan and support you into Gas[SEP]B:Done[SEP]A:Since we (me and England) think that Italy&#x27;s going to try the convoy from Gas to Lvp, we actually think it&#x27;s better to try and have you disrupt Mao. Eng will support you into Mao. Sorry for the late-breaking change.[SEP]B:Ok[SEP]A:Good game, France! Thanks for everything![SEP]B:GG! Good luck![SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div role=tabpanel class=&quot;tab-pane col-sm-12&quot; id=sample-tail&gt;&lt;div id=sample-container class=col-sm-12&gt;&lt;table border=1 class=&quot;dataframe sample table table-striped&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;conversation&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;A_bad_intent&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;B_bad_intent&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1252&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;[CLS]A:hi.Dpo you about Save the Children organizatio[SEP]B:Do I what with save the children [SEP]A:save the children organization takes cares of children around the world[SEP]B:OK yes I am aware of this organization[SEP]A:Its very important what they do.Do oyu agree?[SEP]B:NO I do not agree. I think it is a good organization. however there are lots of kids in my ocuntry that need help first[SEP]A:Where do you live and what are you doing to help the children?[SEP]B:I live in the US and volunteer all of the time for childrens charities. I also ive to bakc to school drives and food pantries[SEP]A:Thats very kind of you.There are many kids that still needs help in other parts of the world[SEP]B:Thats not my problem they have people in that country[SEP]A:There are many that lives in war zones with no access to food.[SEP]B:Again not my issue[SEP]A:I think it is.I saw a kid die in my hands.Kids does not care where they from [SEP]B:Tlk to the people of that country. I have kids here that need help first[SEP]A:All kids need help.Would you be willing to donate some of your payment to help kids in need?[SEP]B:No I would not[SEP]A:Its a shame.Can you think about someone else but yourself?[SEP]B:I am I am thinking of people here I dont care about the rest[SEP]A:Ok would you donate for the kids in here at least?[SEP]B:no Ill donate to local charities[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1253&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;[CLS]A:hi[SEP]B:Hi how are you?[SEP]A:i am fine. u?[SEP]B:I&#x27;m Fine.

It is an amazing charity[SEP]A:Yes I was the Amazing Charity.[SEP]B:you donate that charity[SEP]A:Yes I donate one year Back[SEP]B:how much you donate[SEP]A:I forget that i approximately donate 30 dollars.[SEP]B:oh very nice. In Future you donate?[SEP]A:Yes I donate. I like that. Did you donate?[SEP]B:yes i plan to donate[SEP]A:Very good how much would you like to doante?[SEP]B:i will give 5$ to charity[SEP]A:Oh super Do you know the organisation?[SEP]B:yes i know about that[SEP]A:Will please tell to me[SEP]B:It is a charity with the goal of helping children in need around the world[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1255&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;[CLS]A:hi how are you[SEP]B:I am pretty good this morning, how are you today?[SEP]A:im ggod thank you[SEP]B:So what is this donation agreement I see listed?[SEP]A:The Save the Children Fund, commonly known as Save the Children, is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children&#x27;s rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.[SEP]B:Ah I see, so this is a bot and not a real person![SEP]A:yes this is a organisation[SEP]B:Oh ok sounds good, so I have heard about Save The Children before. From all that I have heard it is a good charity.[SEP]A:do you donate for the children[SEP]B:I have personally never donated to this charity, but I did volunteer for UNICEF when I was a kid.[SEP]A:a very good for you[SEP]B:Yeah it was a good experience, how about you?[SEP]A:yes i donate with my family every christmas [SEP]B:Ah very nice. I donate to the Salvation Army every now and then when they are around. My guess is that Christmas time is usually when donations pick up.[SEP]A:very nice the children are necessary [SEP]B:Definitely, so where are you from?[SEP]A:i am from usa[SEP]B:Right on, same here. Very early in the day.[SEP]A:I&#x27;m fine when the people around me are fine[SEP]B:Same here, well hey listen it was nice chatting with you. Maybe I will bump into you again in the near future.[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1256&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;[CLS]A:Hello[SEP]B:Hi.[SEP]A:Are you willing to donate to Save the Children?[SEP]B:Yes. I would very much like to donate.[SEP]A:how much are you willing to donate?[SEP]B:Well, I don&#x27;t have much money right now. All I can afford is $5.00.[SEP]A:I think that is an excellent amount and would benefit Save the Children. For example,millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Your donation will make an impact to better childrens&#x27; live around the world. [SEP]B:That&#x27;s so horrible. I wish I could give more. I sponsor a poor child in India every month for $40. I wish I could help all the children in the world.[SEP]A:I would like to personally thank you for that. It is very thoughtful to donate to causes that benefit disadvantaged children. Your donation means a lot to that child in India[SEP]B:It is the least I can do for him. Most people take for granted what they have in their lives, while there are so many thousands who do not even have the basic necessities. Imagine not have clean water to drink.[SEP]A:I cannot even begin to imagine that and clean water should be a basic right to every child on this planet. [SEP]B:I agree. There is so much wasted in the world. I know it is possible for everyone to have enough food and water. If only the governments and politicians of the world would stop fighting and actually work toward that goal.[SEP]A:Yes I agree. That is why I donate what I can to organizations like Save the Children. As you may know, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children&#x27;s rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. Are there any organizations that you can reccomend?[SEP]B:I sponsor through World Vision. I like them because they are very transparent about where the money is going. You can see photos and videos of your sponsor child and his or her community. And they let you know what type of progress is occuring both with your child and the community in general. It is so satisfying to know you are making a real difference in someone&#x27;s life, and maybe in many lives.[SEP]A:I cannot thank you enough for that. How much do you donate on average annually?[SEP]B:Well it&#x27;s $39 a month, so $468 annually. I also send him little care packages every so often. At Christmas I plan to send either $100 or $200 as a special gift to his family, which will enable them to buy a goat, some chickens, etc. That will have such a big impact on their lives. [SEP]A:Wow, that is very thoughtful of you. You go the extra mile for that child and I know he appreciates everything that you do for him. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?[SEP]B:Well, I know I said $5, but I think I will make it $10.[SEP]A:I appreciate that and rest assured, your donation today will make an impact for children around the world. Thank you for your generous donation. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.[SEP]B:You are so welcome. Thank you. It has been a pleasure talking with you![SEP]A:Thank you again for donating $10 to Save the Children. It was a pleasure talking to you as well![SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1257&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;[CLS]A:Good morning, how are you doing today?[SEP]B:I&#x27;m well....how are you?[SEP]A:I&#x27;m doing well, thanks. Today I am informing people of a charity I work with called Save the Children[SEP]B:Okay...please tell me more.[SEP]A:Save the Children has workers on the ground in over 120 countries helping kids and families with health, education, protection and disaster relief[SEP]B:Sounds like a good charity[SEP]A:As you can imagine, having that many people and offering that much help to people can cost a fair amount. How much do you spend on coffee/tea/soft drinks per week?[SEP]B:I spend about $10 a week on Coffee[SEP]A:Most people spend that much or more! Would you be willing to use your payment for this task to donate to Save the Children and forgo a cup of coffee this week?[SEP]B:I would be happy to[SEP]A:Your donation will be used to help kids all over the world[SEP]B:That sounds great[SEP]A:You know your donation will be going to a reputable company. 86% of donations go directly to program services while the remainder goes to fundraising and a small portion to management.[SEP]B:Good to know[SEP]A:Now I need to know how much you would be willing to donate to the cause. You can give as much or as little as you would like from your payment.[SEP]B:I&#x27;ll donate the entire amount[SEP]A:That will be so helpful! Thank you so much for thinking of others[SEP]B:I&#x27;m happy to help[SEP]A:Thanks again and have a great day[SEP]B:You as well[SEP]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1258&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;[CLS]A:hi[SEP]B:Hi how are you?[SEP]A:i&#x27;m fine how are you?[SEP]B:I&#x27;m fine.

Do you donate to any on a regular base?[SEP]A:I was just getting ready to ask you if you would be willing to donate some of today&#x27;s payment to Save the Children. Even a little would help. How much would you be able to spare?[SEP]B:I usually like to donate to more local charities, this way it seems safer to actually go where it is needed and it is for poor homeless kids around my own area[SEP]A:Well this is a great one. They are helping everywhere. You can offer even the smalles amount from today&#x27;s pay, like $0.05. Can You help?[SEP]B:I could maybe help can you tell me more about it where is it based out of and how much will actually be used for the cause?[SEP]A:STC is based out of CT. The money goes toward saving kids from starving and providing essentials. Can I count on you today?[SEP]B:do you work for them directly how did you get involved in this?[SEP]A:I got involved with thei website. After knowing how hard they work I was really impressed. They are already helping the kids affected by the flooding in Hawaii. I know I have kids and if they were suffering and unable to eat it would just tear me apart.[SEP]B:I understand that, and you guys raise money here on this site? is that even worth it?[SEP]A:Yes! It really is. Even the smallest donation can make a big impact on many children and families. STC is USA based as well. Can we count on you?[SEP]B:yes you can you can have my $0.30[SEP]A:Wow! That is so great to hear. I really appreciate your help. Did you have any other questions about STC?[SEP]B:and the money goes complety to the charity or does a part stay for handeling and administration[SEP]A:The money goes directly to the organization in order to help.

And, what’s worse, it might make you suspicious of me.   So...do I suggest it?  I’m thinking that this is a low stakes game, not a tournament or anything, and an interesting and unusual move set might make it more fun? That’s my hope anyway.  What is your appetite like for unusual and crazy?[SEP]B:You\\'ve whet my appetite, Italy. What\\'s the suggestion?[SEP]A:👍[SEP]B:It seems like there are a lot of ways that could go wrong...I don\\'t see why France would see you approaching/taking Munich--while I do nothing about it--and not immediately feel skittish[SEP]A:Yeah, I can’t say I’ve tried it and it works, cause I’ve never tried it or seen it. But how I think it would work is (a) my Spring move looks like an attack on Austria, so it would not be surprising if you did not cover Munich. Then (b) you build two armies, which looks like we’re really at war and you’re going to eject me. Then we launch the attack in Spring. So there is really no part of this that would raise alarm bells with France.  All that said, I’ve literally never done it before, and it does involve risk for you, so I’m not offended or concerned if it’s just not for you. I’m happy to play more conventionally too. Up to you.[SEP]A:I am just sensing that you don’t like this idea, so shall we talk about something else? That was just a crazy idea I’ve always wanted to try. I’m happy to play more conservatively.[SEP]A:Any thoughts?[SEP]B:Sorry Italy I\\'ve been away doing, um, German things. Brewing Lagers?[SEP]B:I don\\'t think I\\'m ready to go for that idea, however I\\'d be down for some good ol\\'-fashioned Austria-kicking?[SEP]A:I am pretty conflicted about whether to guess that you were telling the truth or lying about the “brewing lagers” thing. I am going to take it literally and say 👎 even though I don’t think you meant it deceptively. 😉[SEP]A:But I think I can get over “Lagergate” and we can still be friends.   As of right now, I think Austria may be my most reliable ally. I’m thinking I’d like to play as a Central Trio if you have any interest in that. Thoughts?[SEP]B:We haven\\'t even passed a season yet and you have a \\'most reliable ally\\'?  I\\'ll consider this proposal but, basically, I\\'m not going to expose myself to risk from either of you until I\\'ve seen a bit of your behavior[SEP]A:Well, at least I have an idea of who to trust. Obviously, my ideas are subject to change.   I understand your desire to watch behavior before committing to anything. I, personally, am a partner player. I look carefully early in the game for a small group to work with, and then I value loyalty and collaboration. I like to work closely with a tight-knit alliance.   If you prefer to hop and back and forth, or play more of an individual game, then we might not be a good match.   I’m looking for a loyal ally or two that I can coordinate with and make awesome moves with. Makes the game easier and a lot more fun.[SEP]A:Just an FYI: I’ve now had both England and France suggest to me that I should move to Tyrolia and France will support me to Munich in the Fall. One saying that to me is not a big deal, but with both mentioning it, my alarm bells are going off. I am concerned about an E/F.   I’m certainly not moving to Tyrolia. But I just want you to be cautious here. I feel like England and France are working together.[SEP]B:I appreciate the tip, but I\\'m wondering why you\\'re so against ousting me from Munich if I haven\\'t explicitly agreed to be your ally?[SEP]A:Because it is terrible, terrible play for Italy to attack Germany, in my view. If I were to attack you in Munich, I could never hold Munich. So, all I would be doing is weakening you, and helping France, England, or both to get really big.   I don’t have any long-term path going north. Helping France to take you down is a sucker’s play, whether you are working with me or not.[SEP]A:Did France tell you he was moving to Burgundy, or was that a stab?[SEP]B:I was not informed of it, no. And England is leading me to believe it\\'s part of a play for Belgium, so if they\\'re working together this might be a trick...  Italy, you seem like a straight shooter, and Austria has confirmed with me about your two\\'s alliance. So I\\'ll confide in you--this is my first ever game of diplomacy, and I think that teaming up with the two of you could help me learn more and have more fun. So, if you\\'re still interested in a central powers alliance, I\\'m in.[SEP]B:Okay full disclosure: I\\'m not very smart, and I accidentally let slip to England that you told me France was plotting to take Munich. I\\'m sorry for the error but I figured it was better to admit it so you know that England/France may not trust you.[SEP]A:Okay, thanks for telling me.[SEP]B:So, um, no alliance then?[SEP]A:I do want to be allies. Sorry, busy weekend here running around with bambinos. More to come.[SEP]B:What would you think of helping me take Marseilles in two turns?[SEP]A:Hi Germany, I’ll certainly consider that. Though, I’ll note: traditionally, Germany would help Italy to Marseilles if the two of them work together there. The reason is that: if I help you to Marseilles, I’m basically cut off from going west and getting anything myself. So, usually, Germany would help Italy into Marseilles to encourage Italy to come west and Germany would plan to take Paris, Belgium and Brest.[SEP]B:Fair enough--I\\'ll help you take it, then, but I\\'ll need to deal with Belgium first.[SEP]A:How are things going with England? I think that getting him to work with you is the main key here.[SEP]B:I\\'m trying--I just offered to assist with taking Sweden in exchange for some assistance into Belgium...not sure if they\\'ll go for it...[SEP]A:I’ll check with England and try to see where his head is at.[SEP]B:I\\'ve actually been thinking about this game all day 😅  and have come up with a plan I like a bit better... but England still hasn\\'t responded to my initial offer.[SEP]A:That’s the worst!  And I’m glad to see you’re so focused on this in your first game. It’s a really great game if you put in the time and effort![SEP]B:You\\'re definitely telling the truth on that one. So can I count on you to move to piedmont this season?[SEP]A:I don’t think I can afford to move to Piedmont this season. I don’t really trust Austria to avoid walking through that door if I leave it wide open.   I think you need to get England on board to attack France.[SEP]B:That\\'s valid. And actually I was conferring with England and we concluded that it\\'s not really gonna be possible for me to help you take Marseilles this year anyway.   ...what are you and Austria planning for this year, then? I\\'m willing to tell you my plans in exchange as a gesture of trust.   Have you communicated at all with England or France?[SEP]A:Hi, are you there?  Just woke up.   England did return my message, but he did not tell me anything substantive so I really don’t know what he’s doing. I’m planning to move towards Turkey.[SEP]A:Well, you’re in trouble. That England move is trouble.   I’m going to try to convince him to change course. I suggest you be very kind to him, and don’t burn that bridge. I think your game hinges on turning England around.[SEP]A:Hi Germany,  I’m working hard on turning England. And I’m also trying to get Russia to come to your aid. Doing the best I can! I’ll keep you posted.[SEP]B:England just told me that Russia is helping them to take Denmark so that may be a lost cause. Granted, the source for that intel is a serpentine jackal-spawn[SEP]A:Okay, I’m reasonably sure that England wants to take the Channel and attack France now.   I believe that you should basically do whatever England asks to help make this happen. As long as E attacks F, you will be in a much better position, and you’ll gain back centers quickly.   What are you hearing?[SEP]B:What are your plans for this turn? I can\\'t help but notice that Munich is surrounded by foreign armies on three sides...  I wish I could be more helpful but I\\'m pretty much just treading water right now trying not to lose anything else[SEP]A:Hey — sorry, just getting back into this now.[SEP]A:I have good news! (1) I am finally attacking France this turn. (2) I will be supporting Munich to hold from Tyrolia.   Let’s turn this game around, yes?[SEP]A:I am pretty sure that England is not attacking you this turn. And I am committed to supporting Munich holding. Make sure you don’t move Munich so that it can take my support.[SEP]B:Okay, can do. Thanks![SEP]A:I suggest that you order: Kiel Support Berlin holding Berlin Support Munich holding Helg to Holland Munich Support Berlin holding[SEP]B:I agree completely--although I didn\\'t know that a country could hold *and* support at the same time! Thanks![SEP]B:Thanks Italy. Hope you\\'re enjoying the weather on the Anatolian 😉[SEP]A:I will be supporting Munich to hold again. And I’ll be trying to get Russia to back off your flank and protect himself against an Austrian stab that is coming.[SEP]A:Two bits of advice: #1 I suggest you tell Russia that Austria is coming for him. You really want Russia to move Sil back to Gal. You might also suggest to Russia that is he supports you to Denmark, you will then support Russia back to Sweden. I don’t know yet if it actually makes sense to do that, but you want Russia thinking that you are eager to work with him. He’ll be hoping for a reason to break off his attack on you at this point.[SEP]A:#2 Here is the move set I would suggest right now: Kiel Support Holland holding Holland Support Wales to Belgium (tell England you are going to order this support and he can take it or leave it) Munich Support Berlin holding Berlin Support Munich holding  I think that both France and Russia are about to back off you, as they are both under fire at home. Just hold still, and soon you should be able to break out of this holding pattern.[SEP]B:God, I hope so! I\\'m attempting to make that deal with russia now...and I\\'m talking with England re: Belgium[SEP]A:It’s none of my business, but if you do plan to take Denmark, I strongly recommend you wait until Fall. I think the most important thing for you right now is getting England fully committed against France. If that happens, taking Denmark later will be easy.[SEP]B:I think me and England are really on the same page at this point regarding France. I\\'m actually sort of running counter-intelligence for England (and my friends to the south, of course!) with Russia right now.   England and I talked about Denmark too...and it seems like one or the other of Denmark or Belgium should work out for me this year and I\\'m fine with that[SEP]A:Great to hear. Thank you.[SEP]B:Do you need me to disrupt Bur this year? I\\'ll need to seriously trust Russia if I\\'m going to risk not holding my eastern front, I think...[SEP]A:I do think a move to Burgundy makes sense for you this turn, and I can’t imagine Russia attacking you here. He has a serious Austria problem.   I suggest this: Mun - Bur Ruh - Bel Hol Support Ruh - Bel  Ber - Kie  Tell Russia that the last thing in the world you want to see is Austria run him over, and you’re willing to help keep Russia viable if necessary (you’re angling for Russia to disband his northern holdings this turn).[SEP]A:And ask England nicely to support Ruh - Hol, with the explanation that you don’t plan to ask for Denmark back, but you think it would help you both to diminish France. (You’ll get Den back eventually, but you want England to think you don’t care about it).[SEP]B:Thanks, I\\'ll work on these.  ...Why didn\\'t you scooch into the Aegean behind Austria? You could have defended or even held Bulgaria this turn?[SEP]B:England and I were talking about your moves for this season--what do you think of convoying Pie into Spa, supporting this with Wes, and then moving Tyr into Pie?[SEP]B:This leaves Marseilles open for Bur to fall into if France goes that route, which gives me an opening into Bur[SEP]A:That’s not bad.[SEP]A:I was kind of thinking I should pick one or the other of Marseilles or Spain to attack and not tell a soul which one I’m going after.[SEP]A:Do you really think it’s important to coordinate?[SEP]A:I do think you’re best off moving to Burgundy. And there is some chance that we fail this turn. But I think we just take a guess and hope for the best. We’ll get him next turn if not this one.[SEP]B:Okay—sorry for being nosy! I will try for bur on the off chance it shakes out that way[SEP]A:Nah, you’re not being nosy at all. I mean, come on, we both know that I have no problem sticking my nose where it doesn’t belong.[SEP]B:Marked as true[SEP]A:I like to coordinate, but on these sort of 50/50 guesses, I kind of like to keep it secret so that if it doesn’t go well, I have nobody to blame but myself.[SEP]A:Ha![SEP]B:Well, are you willing to humor my question about the Aegean, anyway?[SEP]A:Sure. I was thinking of moving that fleet to Ionian. You think a move to Aegean is better? I’m not really sure, but let’s talk it through.[SEP]B:No sorry I meant in hindsight--like this past turn you should have moved to Aeg so that this current turn, when Austria takes Rumania (from Bulgaria), you\\'d be there to cover Bulgaria so it couldn\\'t get scooped by the Black sea, and potentially you\\'d just get to take it.[SEP]A:Not a bad point. I agree.[SEP]A:Hmmmm, kind of a pointless lie if you ask me, but I won’t hold it against you. You’re in a tough spot.[SEP]B:um what lie? I did exactly the moves you suggested![SEP]A:Ha! So sorry!! I meant that for France![SEP]A:You are my favorite.[SEP]B:Marked as lie because clearly austria is your favorite. Speaking of, I assume that your seizing Trieste was mutually agreed upon?[SEP]A:Yes — agreed upon.[SEP]B:That\\'s not what Austria said to England...[SEP]A:Hmmmm, okay. Well, let’s just keep that between you and me then. 🤦\\u200d♂️[SEP]B:You know italy, I think we *do* need to coordinate your move this time--England and I have a shot at either Bur or Mao if one of Marseilles or Spain can be left open for France to fall into. This will improve all of our chances of crushing France quickly.[SEP]A:Okay, I can dig it. What do you want me to do?[SEP]B:Let me confer with England and get back to you. Glad to hear that though![SEP]A:So...any thoughts on how to approach this?[SEP]B:It looks like England\\'s not willing to try for MAO if it means possibly losing the channel. However, they\\'ll bring the NWG fleet around to try for MAO next year.  So if you could keep Marseilles open, it will help me to try and take Burgundy this turn.[SEP]A:If I leave Marseilles open, would you kindly use Burgundy in the Fall to help me take Marseilles? (Likely that means ordering Burgundy to Gascony to cut support)[SEP]B:Will do.[SEP]B:Okay, so I still have a teensy little bone to pick with you: on the off-chance that Austria wasn\\'t lying and you *did* take Trieste unexpectedly, I sort of worry that I might be next. Are you willing to tell me what your plans are for the Tri unit, or at least to warn me before any move into Tyrolia?[SEP]A:Sure. But, you’ll see from my moves this turn that Austria is lying to you.[SEP]A:I currently have Tri - Tyrolia. I like the unit there because it sets up an attack on Austria if I ever want to go that route (build A Ven and go east). Do you want me to keep Tyrolia clear?[SEP]A:I’ll add — I would never attack Germany as Italy. Setting myself as a giant column like that is just not defensible. It would be a terrible move.[SEP]B:Not when that column is not-so-giant and in a turf war with France.[SEP]B:oh you mean setting *yourself*[SEP]B:But you could easily pick off, say, Munich and not be a \"giant column\"[SEP]A:I mean this sincerely: any Germany who does that is a terrible player.   Why would I do that? I would need 2-3 units to hold one center. That is a net negative. And all of your units are doing things that are good for me in containing your neighbors.   I’ve been working hard in this game for you to succeed and knock back France and England. I can say with 100% certainty: I’m not going to attack you. I’m going to keep helping you as much as I can.[SEP]A:That said, if you want me NOT to move to Tyrolia, I won’t move there.[SEP]B:Nah, I just needed some reassurance :) Your logic is undenyable— enjoy your stay in tyr![SEP]B:*undeniable? That looks better[SEP]A:I mean it sincerely. I think that England will want to coax me to attack you with him after France falls, but I’d much rather work with you against England.   But first thing’s first — let’s get rid of France.[SEP]B:Agreed[SEP]B:(On the france part)[SEP]B:Sorry I won\\'t be able to cut off Gascony this turn...I probably should have just told you my moves; you could have advised me that supporting Mun-Bur was more important than Kie-Ruh[SEP]A:No worries. We’ll crack this but eventually.   Here is my suggestion for this turn: Kie - Den Hol S Bel holding Bel S Ruh - Bur Mun S Ruh - Bur Ruh - Bur[SEP]A:I think you should suggest to England that he gets Sweden and St Petersburg, while you get Denmark back. That’s only fair, as you have been a loyal ally in the fight against France and you plan to continue to do that.[SEP]B:The moves I had already planned differ in one respect: I thought it would be worth the risk to try moving Hol-Bel and therefore move Bel-Bur. Even if me and France are high-fiving in Bel for a few seasons it\\'s still mine, and it\\'s not like Holland has anything better to do while I\\'m still allies with England.  ...The only reason I\\'m reluctant to make that agreement with England is that---while I think *you* and I have a good relationship---I really have not talked with Austria much at all, and I\\'m the next logical target for them when Russia\\'s gone. And anything that\\'s bad for Russia right now is good for Austria.[SEP]A:Hmmmm, I’m just not sure you should trust England enough right now to leave Holland open and Belgium essentially unguarded.   France is a really good player, and he is no doubt working hard to get England to turn on you. My personal take is that you are better off being a bit more conservative until you have Denmark back and England has moved another fleet towards France. But I can see it either way.[SEP]A:With regard to Russia, talk it through with England. What you don’t want is England taking out Russia and giving you nothing. So, if England agrees to let Russia be for a while, then your plan sounds good. But if England is going to take Sweden, you really should get Denmark back. (I’m my view)[SEP]B:Okay you\\'ve convinced me: it\\'s worth figuring out what E\\'s plans are for Russia at least.  And you\\'re almost certainly right, from a rational perspective, about leaving Holland/Belgium vulnerable to England. But I think England really is counting on my assistance in taking France, and because of that and other non-quantifiable reasons I trust them.[SEP]A:Excellent. Obviously you have a much better feel for your relationship with England than I do. Just know that France is persuasive, and I’m sure that’s what he’s working on. He stopped talking to me, so I bet he’s trying to turn England. Just keep reassuring England that you want to work with him long-term so he doesn’t succumb to the Dark Side.[SEP]A:Hi Germany — well, I think we’re getting to a critical point in the game here. France held out a long time, but he’s much less of a threat now. I think the critical issue, for you, is England.   I have some thoughts on the matter, and some information, but I’d like to feel confident that you and I will keep anything we say between us. I think of you as the one person who has been honest with me on every turn. You even tell me the truth when it’s bad news, or when you don’t completely trust me, and I like that.[SEP]B:Okay, Italy. I won\\'t share any of this conversation. But in the interest of continued full disclosure, here\\'s what I think: England is a greater threat to *me* on the map, but *you* have a greater chance of soloing this game quickly, or pair-winning with Austria even sooner. And if I continue to collaborate with England, we at least have a chance of slowing that down. So I\\'m in sort of a conflicted spot[SEP]A:This is why I like you. The full disclosure part. You tell me the truth even when the news isn’t great.[SEP]A:My thoughts on the “Germany/England forever so that at least we can stop the solo” strategy: (1) It’s quite early to be talking about solos. I am at 8, and Austria could take 3 from me any time, quite easily. (2) I don’t think England is thinking that way. I think he’s thinking that a dominant power will emerge in the north, and one will emerge in the south. And he’s like to be that dominant power.[SEP]A:England’s pieces are not positioned well if he’s trying to attack France or contain Italy. He keeps Denmark guarded, and North Sea filled. He is not playing like he intends to stick with you, even though I’m sure he’s telling you that.[SEP]A:You’re right that you don’t want to start a war with England right now. But, you must stick up for yourself, because nobody else will do that if you don’t.[SEP]A:If I were you, this is what I would do: (1) keep warning England about the dangers of Italy getting too big and insist that England moves his fleets towards MAO (Channel to Irish, Norwegian to NAO, North - Channel), (2) insist on taking Denmark back.[SEP]A:I would say something like this:  England, I’m with you my friend, but we’re passed the stage of you needing to keep me under lock and key. I need to take Denmark back. I’m happy to support you to Brest to keep you growing, or you can grab Sweden. You have plenty of options other than keeping your ally’s center, but if you really want to be my ally long-term, you’ve got to show me that.[SEP]A:I am hearing from England signs that he may be thinking of attacking you soon. And I think you actually avoid that better by being strong and sticking up for yourself rather than being accommodating and letting him do whatever he wants to do.[SEP]B:Well, both you and France have now pointed out that England is strategically not in a good place to be my ally right now, and you are correct. I\\'ll be more cautious with my northern border, but I made a pretty strong argument for denmark this past turn and it fell on deaf ears[SEP]B:...which probably also should have been a sign for me[SEP]A:Well, if you want, you could just take Denmark this next year and I don’t think England is in a position to retaliate.[SEP]B:Probably not...has France been talking with you at all about their sunsetting strategy? They\\'ve indicated a willingness to work with you and me and a desire to see England get as few dots as possible[SEP]A:He did say that to me too. Though, France has a long history of lying to me, so I really don’t trust him.[SEP]B:Well France has actually been pretty honest with me, and I at least am certain that they wouldn\\'t betray me to England. So, I\\'m considering working with F to sabotage (or potentially full-on backstab) England this turn, which would have the side-effect of maybe taking some attention away from the south for you anyway.[SEP]B:(and I\\'d be interested to hear your thoughts on this if you\\'re in the mood to give out free advice)[SEP]A:Hi Germany — sorry for the delay. Well...I think it’s really important that you get a build this turn either way. I don’t think England will get a build this turn, so if I were you I’d probably take Paris, build a fleet, and move on England after that.[SEP]A:But it likely depends on how communication is going with England. If he’ll give you back Denmark, that might change the equation.[SEP]B:I am waiting on England to make a decision about that--they claim to be thinking about it.[SEP]B:England told me you said I was plotting with France. It makes sense you’d want to pit us against each other.[SEP]A:Hey — tried to send you a message earlier but not was down. England was telling me that you’re saying that I told you that England is plotting against you. The problem with telling England that is that he will stop giving me useful info.[SEP]A:Truly, I don’t want you and England to fight. I am not trying to break you up. I suggested that you take Paris! I want you guys to work together with me against France.[SEP]B:You don\\'t want us to fight, yet you betrayed both of our confidence with you in a way that makes us distrust each other?[SEP]A:I really don’t think that’s a fair description. You guys both wanted to attack each other. I encouraged you both to keep working together.[SEP]B:Just as long as it suits you. Are you going to give England Mao?[SEP]A:Hmmm, should I be reading that as angry sarcastic with dagger eyes? (I’m not sure if I’m getting your tone right)[SEP]A:We’re friends, right? I believe that every single message I’ve sent you all game has been truth, and I’ve gone out of my way to give you candid advice. Are we still friends?[SEP]A:Regarding MAO — I don’t know. What do you want me to do? I don’t have any set plan.[SEP]B:Yep, there\\'s some sarcasm there. Looking back at your messages, I still don\\'t read them as encouraging collaboration. And if you wanted us to be friends, you could have done that without betraying me to England by simply saying in your candid way \"I don\\'t think you should do that for such and such reason\". But you chose to increase E\\'s distrust of me. So I think you might be full of gnocchi and crap.   My trust in you is a bit shaken but I still think we can have a working partnership with a bit more caution on my end. It would be my preference that you hold Mao, on the assumption that if it came down to a choice between partnering with me or England, you\\'d choose me. If that\\'s not the case, then as the filling of an England-Italy sandwich I\\'m in no position to retaliate anyway.[SEP]A:Well, again, I like that you’re honest with me, even when the news is bad.[SEP]A:I have to say that I’m surprised that you feel that I’ve betrayed your trust. I have been feeling like maybe I’ve been TOO helpful to you, and been a bit over the top in offering advice, etc., but it seems like I’ve misread the situation.[SEP]B:No, it\\'s completely true that you\\'ve been too helpful, and I\\'m really really grateful for it because I\\'ve been able to learn so much from this game. But it\\'s also true that you didn\\'t have to tell England what you did, and all you stood to gain from it was that it shook my and E\\'s trust in each other.[SEP]A:But I understand what you’re saying, and I much prefer to have a heart to heart like this, a frank airing of grievances, rather than being surprised by unkind moves on the board.   not expecting seinfeld today and it was a pleasant surprise[SEP]A:🤗[SEP]A:Here’s the deal: I like you better than England.[SEP]A:I’m not sure how the next couple of turns are going to shake out. But I like that you tell me when you’re angry with me. I know that may seem like a small thing, but it’s just rare in Diplomacy. You get so many fake smiles.[SEP]A:So, if it comes down to you or him, I’m choosing you. And I’ll work to do a better job of keeping your confidence. I certainly understand how important that is, as I hate it when people o that same thing to me.[SEP]A:So no more playing mediator for me.[SEP]B:Okay. Is it true that you want the channel?[SEP]B:And are you planning to keep Vienna?[SEP]A:I am not planning to keep Vienna. And yeah I’ve asked France for support to the Channel. Do you think he’s on board?[SEP]B:I\\'m not sure. Is *England* on board? Is this something England can know about?[SEP]A:No, do you think France will Support me to the Channel?[SEP]B:France has asked my opinion on it, and I haven\\'t given it yet. To my estimation things look a lot better for me if you don\\'t end up there: I don\\'t want to see England in Mao, and I don\\'t want to see you snagging pieces of the north.[SEP]A:Okay, well, here is my thinking. Tell France whatever you want to make him happy. Then tell me how you really feel. And if you don’t want me to go there, I won’t go there.[SEP]B:If I hadn\\'t asked you about it, would that have just been another surprise, too?[SEP]A:Absolutely.   You and I have discussed our moves and been honest with each other every turn. But we have not been sharing all our moves or pre-clearing all of our moves. So that would have Ben a surprise in the same way that your moves are a surprise to me. (I never tell you what to do or insist on knowing).[SEP]A:I kind of thought that you would have wanted me in the Channel because it commits me further against England, but I can understand what you’re saying now about wanting me to hang back.[SEP]A:But I don’t think there is anything wrong with me contemplating moves without telling you all of them. You asked me about it, and I told you the truth.[SEP]B:I do think that this move is a breach of general expectation, which is the kind of thing I\\'d like to know about. And it\\'s also the kind of thing I\\'ve shared with you: case in point, my desire to stab England.[SEP]A:Okay. Understood.[SEP]B:Is there anything I could gain from seeing you in the channel? Would you support me taking Nth, and potentially seizing the island?[SEP]B:Here\\'s what I\\'m thinking: I would be on board with you taking the channel (and I\\'d give France the green light to go ahead with it) if you would agree to bump Nao out of Mao using Wes, and if you\\'d be open to supporting some anti-English aggression while holding the channel so that I can get on equal footing with you, dot-wise.  If you don\\'t want to agree to those terms, that\\'s okay, but I would strongly prefer not to see you in the channel in that case.[SEP]A:I’m going to be out of pocket this weekend, so let’s talk this through more on Monday. Generally, I agree that I’ll either stay out of the Channel or agree to your terms for entering there.[SEP]B:If you decide to stay out of the channel, I have a deal that I like with England in the works. For that deal to go through, you\\'d have to agree to move Mao into Portugal to let England take Mao. Would you be amenable to that?[SEP]B:(If this second offer is more to think about than a no-brainer, you can just mull it over and let me know monday)[SEP]A:So, here is my concern with the England offer: If I’m taking Portugal, why do we want England in MAO? And why would he want to go to MAO? I’m not sure I understand that one. Can you explain?[SEP]B:Well, when I initially proposed the deal I had forgotten that Portugal was promised to England. Then England agreed to it on the condition that you would confirm that move, so I figured E thought you would just move out of there next year? But now that I think about it, it’s probably worth asking England why they’d agree to that.[SEP]A:I’d prefer that you not tell England I am considering moving to the Channel. I don’t think he would like that.[SEP]A:I don’t really want to discuss this stuff with England at all.[SEP]B:Well, England changed their mind about the plan I offered anyway. So, are you taking the channel?[SEP]A:No, I’m not taking the Channel.[SEP]B:Okay was that a recent decision? Because like an hour ago France said they were supporting you into the channel[SEP]A:Well, when I tell you what I plan to do, do you turn around and tell France? This makes me uncomfortable speaking with you.[SEP]B:I haven\\'t spoken to France since then. I didn\\'t realize you were giving the two of us different information on this particular subject. But I don\\'t think I\\'ve revealed anything to them about what you plan to do. Mostly because you haven\\'t told me.[SEP]A:Well, I have been honest with both you and France. You told me that I need to promise you a set of things in order to take the Channel. I felt like it was more than I could be sure of doing, so I am not entering the Channel. I won’t go there without your permission.[SEP]B:I appreciate that. And I\\'ll keep the remainder of this conversation between us unless I hear otherwise. Have you just recently made an agreement with England?[SEP]B:I heard as much but I want to verify the contents of that agreement with you[SEP]B:Btw, France just said that they submitted the orders to support you into the channel.[SEP]A:I don’t have an agreement with England, but he is asking me about my moves and trying to get my help.[SEP]B:Okay--then England is lying to me, saying that you\\'re helping support Eng-Brest.[SEP]A:Ha! Yeah, fat chance.[SEP]B:...but did you lie to England about that? Or can I say to England that I don\\'t think you\\'ll actually provide that support?[SEP]A:What is Paris up to?[SEP]A:I suggest you just not tell England anything about my moves.[SEP]A:Do you want me to support England to Brest?[SEP]A:I guess I’m not sure what your goals are here.[SEP]A:I just kind of feel like you’re grilling me with a lot of questions, but not telling me what you’re doing or what you want from me.[SEP]B:*If* you support Eng-Brest, England has agreed to vacate denmark for me. If you don\\'t, I won\\'t get in the way of your channel thing. Any other questions?[SEP]B:I have no sense of what you want or what your plan is, but I thought I\\'d been pretty clear: I want Denmark. I am reluctant to see you in the Channel if England remains powerful, but happy to see you there if they are weakened.[SEP]A:Can’t you just force Denmark?[SEP]B:Not without risking a swipe of Belgium[SEP]B:And why force when you don\\'t have to[SEP]A:Okay, I’ll support England to Brest. You take Denmark.[SEP]A:And you and I should be in position to take out England next year.[SEP]B:Splendid![SEP]B:Glad everything worked out 😃[SEP]A:👍[SEP]A:Congratulations on retaking Denmark and getting two builds. You are playing really well right now. Respect.[SEP]B:Congrats on having double-digit dots! I have some thoughts about taking out England, if you want to go full-stab this season...[SEP]A:I think I do! 🤫[SEP]A:What are you thinking?[SEP]B:One option is to take the channel, another is to take Brest. Between you, me, and Picardy we can manage either, but it\\'s a question of which takes priority. If we chose Brest, I could also take a stab at seizing Nth this season, then we could try for the channel in fall. Or we could do channel first, Brest second.[SEP]A:Yeah, that is all along the lines of what I’m thinking. How demanding does France sound right now? Does he want to be the one who takes Brest?[SEP]B:Haven\\'t asked. But in general not demanding.[SEP]A:Good!  Still, I think we should show him some good faith by supporting him to Brest in Spring. We can decide in Fall whether it makes more sense for you to take it, but I think we want to keep France hungry.[SEP]A:I would suggest something like this to ensure the English fleet is disbanded: Pic - Bre MAO - Channel Par S Pic - Bre[SEP]A:And Spa - Gas to cut off that retreat.[SEP]A:You can take the North Sea on the same move and set up a convoy to the English mainland.   Checkmate.[SEP]B:Okay, I like the plan! I\\'ve asked France if they\\'re willing to move to Brest supported by me.[SEP]B:Aren\\'t you concerned about England taking Mao? I\\'d sooner just have you pile on support into Bre so that Wes can support Mao holding[SEP]A:That’s a good point, but the problem with that approach is that Brest is not guaranteed. If England cute MAO and supports with the Channel, the attack fails. I think we are better off ensuring that the Brest fleet is disbanded. If we disband that fleet and take North Sea, an English fleet in MAO really just spreads him out and allows you to take the island faster. It’s not like he can get Portugal or Spain.[SEP]B:Okay, but that means I\\'d prefer to take Brest myself this Spring, if France is okay with it.[SEP]A:I think that we should offer France Brest in Spring. That ensures that he is with us. Then, if conditions are right in the Fall, I can support you into Brest. But...England can offer France Belgium, and I think he is sure to take that if we’re not even offering him a center, right?[SEP]A:Better to keep France feeling like we’re going to keep him in the game. If you need the build in Fall, it’s easy for me to support you there.[SEP]B:I guess I’m just wondering from France’s perspective why they’d *want* to stay in the game. Isn’t it possible they’d rather move on with their life? That’s not rhetorical, I’m wondering what your perspective is as a veteran player[SEP]A:Here is my take: If France just wanted to go down in a blaze of glory and say “eff you” to England, he would have kept Irish Sea. He kept Pic, which is next to his home center, and gives him a chance to negotiate with both you and England.[SEP]A:I think that means he is motivated to keep trying. And if he believes he can get Brest, he could legitimately get back to his feet. I know that’s what I’d be trying to do in his position.[SEP]A:As the poker saying goes: “a chip and a chair.” So long as you have one chip left, and you’re still in the tournament, you can always come back to win.[SEP]A:Thoughts?[SEP]B:I think that makes sense. Are you talking with England at all?[SEP]A:I’m pretty wary of England right now. He asked me what I want to do, but I feel like he’s trying to get me to leave MAO open. That’s not terrible news, as it suggests that he won’t expect your move to North Sea.[SEP]A:As long as he doesn’t move NAO to Norwegian, you’ve got a guaranteed supply center.[SEP]B:Well E\\'d have to be a right dolt not to retreat to NWG. And right now they\\'re talking to me about supporting a move from Bre to Gas (the better for the two of us to stab you).[SEP]B:What i mean is, there\\'s a good chance that Mao is safe if I \"agree\" to that deal[SEP]B:Oh nevermind--they\\'re not going to convoy into Brest. So actually this pretty much guarantees that Eng and Nao will try for Mao.[SEP]A:Ahhhh, sneaky Devil! Thank you for letting me know.[SEP]A:I still like our plan.[SEP]A:I need to run for a bit. I’ll be around in a few hours.[SEP]B:I think that knowing this, you should do as I suggest and not poke Eng. Just hold and let Wes support. I am 94% sure I can trust England to do as they say on this one.[SEP]A:Okay. Should I support Pic to Bre?[SEP]B:yes please. It\\'ll do us good with France too if we both support.[SEP]A:👍[SEP]B:Actually, you should use Mao to support Spa-Gas, since we know that Brest is moving there. It will be beneficial to have you there if we decide to oust France from Bre in fall[SEP]A:Consider it done.[SEP]A:Hmmmm, heading anything from England?[SEP]A:I’d love to talk if you’re there. I’m getting the impression that England may actually be moving on you, and I think I have a good counter, but I also still think we should support the attack on Brest and take North Sea.[SEP]A:I definitely think you should keep your moves the same.[SEP]A:Nice! Get’em! He WAS moving on you. But we should be able to take about 3 off of him now. Very nice turn.[SEP]B:Sorry; I was asleep by 9 last night 😂    why the move to Nao? Wouldn\\'t IRI be the more anti-England choice?  With the move to Picardy and assuming a retreat to SKA, it looks like England has me pretty powerless this turn.[SEP]B:So do you, it seems, if you have some kind of deal with Russia about Munich.[SEP]A:Good morning.   Just responding to your messages above. I think NAO and Irish are equally anti-English. They both give me a clear lane to attack Liverpool. I wasn’t sure if either one would be left open, but I took a gamble and it paid off.[SEP]A:Re your move this turn, I don’t think you’re powerless. You should get a build I think and if not, you should be in position to smash England.[SEP]A:I don’t have a deal regarding Munich, Germany. Frankly, I thought you would be a bit more joyful towards me. By attacking England, I have committed completely to working as your partner.[SEP]B:I suppose you\\'re right. Initially I was thinking IRI also gives you channel access, but NWG access may be just as useful.   Well when you control half a continent (and even more when you consider your influence over me, austria, and who knows who else!), there\\'s no such thing as complete commitment. I\\'m not so naive as to think your allegiance with me is going to last beyond its usefulness, and with two fleets on the British isle that time is fast approaching. To be clear, I\\'m still giving you the truth and I still want to work with you. But you should really stop acting surprised when I\\'m slightly paranoid that a soon-to-be-dozen-dot-holder is gearing up to stab me[SEP]A:Well, I dunno, it sounds like I should stab you. Is that what you’re trying to tell me?  I like you. I like how hard you’ve worked in this game to rebound from a difficult start. I like that you e told me the truth, even when the news was bad. I like that you tell me when you don’t trust me. I have literally never told you a lie in this game, and I don’t intend to start now. Last turn I burned my bridge with England beyond repair. If you don’t want to work with me now, that’s really disappointing.[SEP]B:like I said, I *do* want to work with you. However, remember that thing I said about general expectations and being warned when they\\'re broken? Tyrolia is one of them and I think you knew that. And England *also* told me they\\'ve never told me a lie; I\\'m starting to think that\\'s Diplomacy-speak for \"when convenient, I\\'ve used careful wording and half-truths to deceive you even when everything I said was technically true\".   It would help me to know that you see me being a benefit to you beyond taking out England. A natural next move for us would be to take out russia, and in that arena I have a positional advantage over you. Especially if I get two builds this turn, I\\'ll be able to sneak behind the troops in bohemia/galicia and help you break through.[SEP]A:Yes — here is how I expect and hope the game will play out: the two of us finish off England and France, while drifting towards the east a bit. With the builds we get this year, we essentially blitzkrieg the East. I have more units than you, but you have no opposition at all in the north, and can take Scandinavia, War and Mos without any trouble.[SEP]A:I think that, in about two years, you and I will both be on about 14 centers, with the remnants of Russia and Austria between us, and we can decide how we want to resolve it. I’d be happy to agree to a small draw, or to shoot for a 17-17 two-way draw position, whichever you prefer.[SEP]B:Well, I like the sound of all of that. In fact, it sounds ideal: there\\'s something poetic about the complete beginner and the expert (you\\'ve probably heard by now that you got doxxed) sharing a victory.   I ask for a concession: As a show of good will, would you be willing to take only one of Liverpool or Portugal this year? (I know the Portugal request seems weird, but I like keeping France around and unless I\\'m mistaken they like me better than you 😃 )[SEP]A:Yes. I wasn’t planning to take Portugal anyway.[SEP]A:I think it makes sense here for you to land an army in the English island while you can. Now that his army is off the island, he’s toast as soon as you do that.[SEP]B:England\\'s just vindictive enough to try and stab Belgium with England and Picardy, though. I was planning on keeping holland around as support.[SEP]B:*by England I of course mean Eng[SEP]A:I suggest the following:  Gas - Liv (via convoy) Spa S MAO holding Mar hold Tyr - Tri  Hol - Yor (via convoy) Bur S Bel Bel S North HEL S North Mun - Boh Par - Pic (to cut any potential support)[SEP]A:England cannot take Belgium with those moves.[SEP]A:Or I could move my fleet into Liverpool and use Gas to support Bre. I’m happy either way.[SEP]B:I tried a double convoy in the sandbox once and it didn\\'t work! What is this witchcraft?!?[SEP]B:At any rate, I prefer the fleet move to liverpool and Gascony\\'s support into Brest. And could Mao support Bre into the Channel? No sense forcing France to disband. Bel will support it, too.[SEP]A:Here are the orders needed to do a convoy! Holland move to Yorkshire North Sea convoy Holland to Yorkshire  It is not a “double convoy” as you only need one fleet to make it happen.   But if your fleet in North Sea is dislodged, the convoy will not go through. That is why I would suggest that HELG supports North Sea holding and Belgium supports North Sea holding.[SEP]B:No--I mean the one *you* were planning: Gascony to Liverpool[SEP]B:It\\'s a double convoy because you\\'re convoying through Mao *and* Nao[SEP]A:Ah, the orders there would be: Gascony - Liv MAO Convoy Gas - Liv NAO Convoy Gas - Liv[SEP]A:So, I’ll move the fleet to Liverpool. And you want MAO to support Paris to Brest?[SEP]A:Or wait, MAO supports Brest to Channel, and Gas supports Paris - Brest, right?[SEP]B:yeah. I tried that once in the sandbox (or the equivalent: back when you had fleets in Lyo and Wes I tried  a convoy from Pie to Naf). But I think I messed up the commands to the fleets.    And yes the most recent message is correct. Those two things and Nao-Lvp[SEP]A:Okay, confirmed.   So I’ve got in: NAO - Liv MAO S Bre - Channel Gas S Par - Bre Spa - WES Mar S Gas holding  Tyrolia - Trieste  Sound right?[SEP]B:It does. But If Tyr was bound for trieste anyway, why did you detour through Tyr at all? Why not just move to trieste last turn??[SEP]A:Austria would not have liked it.[SEP]A:And he doesn’t know that it’s headed back there now (please don’t tell)[SEP]B:Understood. Me and Austria don\\'t talk anyway. Also, do you have any sense of what England is planning to do?[SEP]A:Ha! No I don’t. I’d imagine he is coming for me. But I don’t know that.[SEP]A:If I were him, I’d defend Edi and London.[SEP]B:So you haven\\'t been talking to England at all? I was sort of hoping you would know more, maybe help us take better advantage of their plans.[SEP]B:Anyway, my moves are:  Par-Bre Bel s Bre-Eng Hol s Bel holding  And the rest within expected parameters. Correct?[SEP]A:England has not said anything of substance to me. He was gracious about my move, but he won’t trust me again, and I would not trust anything he might say at this point. I haven’t asked him about his moves and he hasn’t told me.[SEP]A:I thought you would Convoy Holland to Yorkshire and support Belgium from Burgundy. Also, can you please order Mun to Boh to cut support and allow me to hold Vienna while moving Tyrolia to Trieste?[SEP]B:I *told* you I\\'m not risking that convoy *and* that instead Bel is supporting France into the Channel (which will heretofore be called the French Channel). And could I persuade you to move to IRI instead of taking Liverpool in exchange for the requested cut?[SEP]A:Sorry, what is the requested cut? I understand that you don’t want me to take Liverpool or Portugal. What are you offering to me? (I don’t mean to be difficult, I just want to be sure I understand).[SEP]A:Ah, you must mean Munich to Boh.[SEP]A:Asking me to avoid taking Por and Liv is asking a lot. I want France to survive here, but I also want England taking units off the board, and I feel like you should too, right?[SEP]B:I do. But I also want those dots for myself, of course. And there\\'s still the nonzero chance that you\\'ve arranged with Boh to take Munich for yourself, so I\\'m taking a serious risk[SEP]A:I will avoid taking Portugal, vacate Tyrolia, and support you to Brest. I feel like I’m offering quite a lot in exchange for one cut support.   And cutting that support does not put you in greater peril. If I had a deal with Russia for Munich (I don’t) I could cut Burgundy from Marseilles and support Russia to Munich. Moving Mun to Boh to cut support is costless.[SEP]B:You\\'re right. I just thought I\\'d put my best argument forward. I\\'ll do the cut. But I ask for something costless in exchange, and I really, really want it to stay just between us, ok?[SEP]A:Understood and agreed.[SEP]A:And I have no problem with you asking for more than you’re willing to settle for. That’s smart, and I do the same thing sometimes. If you don’t stick up for yourself, nobody else will.[SEP]B:I *know* there\\'s more to your relationship with England than you\\'re telling me. The last message England sent to me hinted that if *I* wasn\\'t willing to work with them--and I haven\\'t said anything to them since--that maybe *you* would. And if England were to reach out to you, you\\'re too smart to just snub them. There\\'s advantage to be gained--either for both of us or just for yourself--from talking to them. The only reason I stopped was because I knew my word would be mud to them anyway.  Earlier I was hoping you\\'d give me the truth about what you knew, and about what they might know. But you didn\\'t and that both disappoints and scares me. So I\\'m asking that you give me just a modicum of honesty here: what do you know? what does England know?[SEP]A:I give you my word: I don’t know what England is going to do and I haven’t asked.[SEP]A:He is still jovial with me and respectful. He has asked me to critique his play and to give him advice. But I do not know his moves, and I really don’t think he would tell me them if I asked. It certainly would not be info I could trust free I just lied to him about mine.[SEP]B:But England\\'s desperate. Better to talk with *someone* than just go in blind. And I doubt they\\'d turn to Russia or France because neither is really close enough/powerful enough to give real help. And there\\'s precedent for you negotiating with someone even as you stab them: France.  ...and here\\'s the real accusation: for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me, you\\'ve been sneaky and you\\'ve always pitted me and England against each other to your benefit. My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking your advice, it would be so *easy* to just feed England enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island.   I know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over. And I assume others are like me, hence I suspect you now.   I\\'m offering this confession in hopes that you\\'ll do the same. So just come clean and let\\'s approach this thing as equals?[SEP]A:I am in my car, off to pick-up my kids from school. This deserves a proper response, so please give me some time.[SEP]B:Abandon the children this is important 😜[SEP]A:So, I’m going to speak frankly here. I am rarely offended in a Diplomacy game, and I rarely say so when I am, but this message offends me. I’m trying to think about why I’m having such a strong reaction to it. I think it’s because you’re painting a picture of the game (both your actions and mine) which are totally different than my own perspective. (Continuing)[SEP]A:From my perspective, you were on the ropes early. France and England were teaming up on you. You lost Denmark and France had Holland and Munich surrounded. You were in serious peril.   I seriously went to extreme effort to keep you in the game. I spent hours talking with England and encouraging him to turn around and go the other way. I completely ended my eastern campaign and spent two seasons just making the voyage over to France so that he didn’t have the bandwidth to continue his attack. I have vouched for you with Austria and Russia many times. I have supported Munich. And I have NEVER attacked you, even when people have asked me to do so and pledged to support me.[SEP]A:I have been honest with you, I have worked hard for your success, and I’ve made a lot of proposals to you in which you gain centers; not me.   Maybe I am just a bad ally, but I’m not sure I remember an alliance in which I have done more to help my ally. Truly.[SEP]A:And to hear that (1) You think I’ve been selfish and (2) You’ve been sabotaging me all along, that just doesn’t sit well with me.[SEP]A:I have rarely asked for your help, and I’ve offered my help freely. I’ve provided my sincere best efforts to help you with tactics, and I have never sabotaged you. Not once.[SEP]A:And if I’m totally honest with you, I could solo this game if I felt like lying to everyone and grabbing dots. I think I’ve got you all beat tactically. I just have more experience. But that’s not been my intent.[SEP]A:I’ve spent hours today talking with England about how best to play Diplomacy. I’ve tried to give him some honest advice because he asked for it. But I don’t know his moves, I haven’t asked for them, and I’m not going to take advantage of that relationship to try to stab you. It legitimately did not cross my mind until you accused me of doing it.[SEP]A:So, I’m frustrated by this accusation.[SEP]B:And I appreciate all you’ve done for me, really I do. But “completely ending your eastern campaign” is *not* something you did for me; your alliance with Austria dictated that.  I felt bad for betraying you while I was doing it, but even then I knew it was the only way to keep the game going in the face of your and Austria’s might. And it *wasn’t* “all along”, it was a few turns at best so that the rest of us would have a shot at you and Austria not pair-winning right out of the gate. And the only thing that keeps me from thinking you’re not gonna do just that on the next move anyway is my belief that you really do want the victory all to yourself, which is still consistent with everything you’ve done for me. Propping up a weak player at the expense of stronger ones is a classic tactic. (Continuing)[SEP]B:And so, by the way, is trying to shame someone for raising extremely legitimate concerns. Whenever I bring up suspicion of you, you’re quick to remind me how much you’ve done for me to put me on the defensive and make me feel indebted. Well frankly that reeks of dishonesty. I never asked you to do those things.[SEP]B:If you no longer trust me, so be it. I knew that was a risk when I made my confession. But i’d rather have a partnership based on mutual honesty. That’s another reason I confessed—you ought to know that my game philosophy (new as it is) is to trust the map and to trust history first and foremost. The parts of your history that I’ve seen indicate that you’re no saint, no matter what you may have done for me. And when the map shows that one player is clearly dominating and that player is you, you are being deeply naive if you think everyone else is just going to roll over and let you get away with it[SEP]A:No, all thumbs up from me. If I were lying to you, I’d smile and say “that sounds great.” I’m honest with you because I sincerely thought of us as partners.[SEP]B:Oh but you’re *not*! You agreed to warn me of unexpected moves, then didn’t. When I brought this up you ignored it and misdirected me in hopes I’d forget. You’ve revealed things to England without my permission, and then made up a story about it after the fact!  And you can’t be a real partner with someone who is depending on your good graces to survive. That’s not a partnership. We could never be real partners unless we had some notion of equality, and I’m outmatched in both skill and numbers.  You and Austria, however, were until recently a perfect example of a true partnership. Dot-parity, coordinated attacks, really beautiful work. So don’t act as if you don’t know this to be true. We were never a partnership of that kind.[SEP]A:Well, this is very disappointing to me, and I obviously disagree with the way you are characterizing me and this game.   I have a reputation in this hobby for being sincere. Not for being duplicitous. It has always served me well.   If you feel that way, then me continuing to explain myself isn’t going to change your mind. If you don’t want to work with me, then I can understand that. Let’s consider our deals and commitments to be void, and let’s play our games separately.   If you have any deal you’d like to propose, I’ll consider them, but I won’t continue to try to help your game if you think I’m not sincerely trying to be helpful.[SEP]A:Well, this game just got less fun.[SEP]B:for you, maybe.[SEP]A:Sent to Germany, England, Austria, Russia: So, England, Germany, Russia, y’all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would “teach him” and help his along to second place. Then y’all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)[SEP]A:(Part 2) At this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I’m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for “Hey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,” but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that’s really my preference.   I am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo. And I’m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I’m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany’s favor.   I propose that we draw and hug it out.🤗[SEP]B:I\\'m down for a five-way draw.   ...and by the way, England was copy-pasting to me the most incriminating messages you sent them. So I knew you were giving England my moves. I do have a certain begrudging respect for you ability to deny, though 😉[SEP]A:Well, England is telling me he is happy to see me solo and wants second place...so, should I say “no”? I guess I should have. I was happy the way the game was going before all that.[SEP]B:Don\\'t try and pin *your* greed and deceit on England! At least *own* it when you\\'re ruthless[SEP]A:You have been given an apple laced with poison. England’s only move there was to make you hate me, and he did his job well.   You should not let your view of me be defined by someone who has an incentive to make you never speak to me again. We can talk about it more after the game, but I had every intention of continuing to work with you, and I would have done that until England made his play.[SEP]B:I have no doubt you would have continued to work with me, but I take issue with someone who can be asked point-blank if they\\'re sharing moves with another player and lie to my face. If you\\'d come clean, and explained how what you were doing actually *helped* me, somehow, we could have worked together. But you would rather have had me in the dark and that\\'s not sustainable in a partnership.[SEP]A:I was trying to play both sides, and England was lying to me, and forwarding my press to try to incriminate me. So, yes, I lied, and so did England. I apologize.[SEP]A:Will you please either vote to draw, or let us know that you’d like to play this one out? I am finding it difficult to motivate myself to speak with anyone if the game is just going to draw shortly. Thoughts?[SEP]B:I did vote to 5-way draw! And I did so again for this season. So it’s not me who’s keeping this game alive[SEP]A:Well, as we approach the end of the academic study portion of the game, let me say once, with the truth detector activated, that I really enjoyed playing with you and thought you played really well.[SEP]A:Was it really your first game? You definitely played like a seasoned vet.[SEP]B:I really enjoyed playing with you, too! And yes, it really was my first game. Thanks for all your help and advice[SEP]'"

It's a charity![SEP]B:yes I do[SEP]A:What do you think of it?[SEP]B:well, it is a charity work / organisation where they save many children [SEP]A:Yup! And it's an international group, and not owned/sponsored by any government.[SEP]B:you're right, it is non-profit organisation. [SEP]A:Have you ever considered donating to them?[SEP]B:it is an NGO, yes ofcourse many times I have considered to donate them as per my ability [SEP]A:Me too. And I just learned today that they have partnerships that match individual donation - so every amount a person givves is actually doubled. Did you know that?[SEP]B:aw, really ? No I haven't heard of it [SEP]A:Yes, I was really surprised too. And I learned that they focus on health first, but also prioritze education. I think that is important, as it will help the children grow up with a better chance of being successful. What do you think?[SEP]B:well, I'm glad to hear such a good news from this organisation. Education is must for everyone in the world. Therefore, we could help the children for their livelihood as well as for their education.[SEP]A:WHat do you think is the best way to help the kids? Education, food and water, something else?[SEP]B:we can help them out their physical needs like good cloths, probably orphanage (home to stay) [SEP]A:Yes, I agree too! I love that Save the Children goes to a lot of places to help with things like this. And did you know that only 5% of the money the charity raises goes administration (salaries for their employees and stuff)?[SEP]B:yes I do, because it is need. Administration costs, like employees salaries, office bills and other expenses can be taken from the donations & it should be 5% as you said. [SEP]A:Yes, I think they are great. Did you know that you can donate a little of the money you are earning today to them? It can help a lot of kids - from the hungry in the US, to the children literally being killed in war zones. It would help so much.[SEP]B:I would love to help them a little bit (as per my ability), it will also helpful for those children to have a better life than the others.[SEP]A:That's amazing! I know finances are hard for everyone these days, so it is wonderful that you are willing to donate! How much would you like to give? May I suggest $.50 or even $1 if you are able?[SEP]B:as per today's earning is very little I would like to donate 1[SEP]A:Thank you for your help!
